## Overview

The test insights dashboard provides instructors and graders with analytics on test difficulty, common error patterns, and student progress toward full marks.

## Accessing test insights

Navigate to `/course/{course_id}/manage/assignments/{assignment_id}/test-insights`

Available to instructors and graders.

## Performance overview tab

### Summary metrics

View key statistics at a glance:

- **Total submissions**: Active submissions with grader results
- **Tests analyzed**: Number of unique test cases
- **Average pass rate**: Overall success rate across all tests
- **Hardest test**: Test with lowest pass rate

### Overall score distribution

Visual bar chart showing how students scored across all tests:

- **100%**: Perfect scores
- **90-99%**: Near-perfect
- **80-89%**: Good performance
- **70-79%**: Satisfactory
- **60-69%**: Needs improvement
- **50-59%**: Struggling
- **1-49%**: Significant issues
- **0%**: Failed attempts

### Test performance table

Detailed breakdown for each test:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Test name | Name of the test case |
| Part | Test part identifier (if applicable) |
| Difficulty | Classification based on pass rate |
| Pass rate | Percentage of students passing |
| Avg score | Mean score across all attempts |
| Attempts | Total number of submissions |
| Passing | Count of successful attempts |
| Failing | Count of failed attempts |

#### Difficulty levels

- **Easy**: 80%+ pass rate (green)
- **Medium**: 60-79% pass rate (yellow)
- **Hard**: 40-59% pass rate (orange)
- **Very hard**: <40% pass rate (red)

### Submissions to full marks

Track how many attempts students need to achieve perfect scores:

- **Students with full marks**: Count who achieved 100%
- **Students without full marks**: Count still working toward 100%
- **Average submissions**: Mean attempts to reach full marks
- **Median submissions**: Middle value of attempts distribution

## Common errors tab

### Error exploration

Identify and analyze recurring error patterns:

- **Occurrence count**: Number of students encountering the error
- **Average score**: Mean score for submissions with this error
- **Sample outputs**: Representative error messages
- **Affected submissions**: List of submission IDs

### Filtering errors

Refine the error list using filters:

- **Test name**: Filter by specific test
- **Test part**: Filter by test part
- **Min occurrences**: Show errors affecting at least N students
- **Search output**: Text search within error messages

### Sorting options

Sort errors by:

- **Occurrence count**: Most common errors first (default)
- **Average score**: Lowest scoring errors first
- **Test name**: Alphabetical order

### Error deduplication

The system automatically groups similar errors by normalizing:

- Memory addresses (`0x...` → `<hex>`)
- Timestamps → `<timestamp>`
- Line numbers (`at line 42` → `at line <N>`)
- Large numbers → `<num>`

This ensures variations of the same error are grouped together.

## Error pins integration

Link common errors to discussion posts to help students:

### Creating error pins

1. Click "Create Error Pin" on any error group
2. Search for relevant discussion threads
3. Select the thread explaining the solution
4. Click "Create Error Pin"

When students encounter this error, they'll see a link to the discussion post.

### Viewing existing pins

The modal shows existing error pins that match the pattern:

- Thread subject and creation date
- Number of submissions linked
- Direct link to view the discussion

## Use cases

### Identifying difficult concepts

- Review tests with low pass rates
- Check common error patterns
- Create targeted discussion posts or office hours topics

### Improving assignments

- Adjust test difficulty based on pass rates
- Clarify instructions for frequently failed tests
- Add hints for common error patterns

### Supporting students

- Link error pins to helpful discussion posts
- Identify students needing additional help
- Track progress toward full marks

### Curriculum planning

- Compare test difficulty across assignments
- Identify concepts requiring more class time
- Adjust pacing based on submission attempts

## Best practices

- Review test insights after the first wave of submissions
- Create error pins for the top 3-5 most common errors
- Use score distributions to calibrate test difficulty
- Export data for longitudinal analysis across semesters
