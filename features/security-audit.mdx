## Overview

The security audit dashboard allows instructors to search all submission file contents for specific strings to detect potential academic integrity violations, prohibited library usage, or security concerns.

## Accessing the dashboard

Navigate to **Assignment > Security Audit** from the assignment management navigation. This feature is restricted to instructors only.

## Searching submissions

<Steps>
<Step title="Enter search term">
Enter the string you want to search for in the search input field. The search is case-insensitive and searches the full contents of all submission files.

Common search terms:
- `java.io.File` - Detect prohibited file I/O
- `FileInputStream` - Find file system access attempts
- `/autograder/` - Identify attempts to access grading files
- Specific library names or patterns
</Step>

<Step title="Execute search">
Click **Search All Submissions** or press Enter to scan all submission files for the assignment.

The search runs across all active submissions and displays results in real-time.
</Step>

<Step title="Review results">
Results display in a sortable table showing:
- Student name (linked to submission)
- Student email
- Class section
- Lab section
- Submission number
- Autograder score
- File name with line number
- Matched content preview
- GitHub file link
</Step>
</Steps>

## Viewing grader output

Click **View Output** on any result to open a modal displaying:
- Submission score
- Link to full submission
- GitHub file link
- Instructor-visible grader output
- Link to complete grader results

The modal shows instructor-only output that may contain additional context about why the submission failed or what violations were detected.

## Exporting results

Click **Export All to CSV** to download a spreadsheet containing:
- All matched results
- Student information
- Submission details
- File locations
- GitHub links
- Matched content
- Search term used

The CSV filename includes the assignment slug and export date for easy organization.

## Use cases

### Detecting prohibited libraries

Search for specific import statements or library usage that violates assignment requirements:

```
java.io.File
FileReader
FileWriter
```

### Finding file system access

Identify students attempting to access the grading environment:

```
/autograder/
/grader/
expected_output
```

### Academic integrity investigations

Search for suspicious patterns or shared code segments across submissions.

## Submission metadata export

From any submission view, instructors can export complete submission history including:
- All submission attempts with metadata
- Autograder results and test output
- Grading reviews
- File diffs between submissions
- Commit information

Click the export icon in the submission header to download a Markdown file containing the full submission history.

## Access control

- **Instructors only**: Security audit dashboard and metadata export
- **RLS policies**: Database-level access control enforces instructor-only permissions
- **UI gating**: Export buttons hidden from graders

## Technical details

The security audit uses Supabase's `ilike` operator for case-insensitive pattern matching across submission file contents. Results are fetched via a TableController that provides real-time updates and efficient pagination.

Search results include contextual snippets showing the matched content with surrounding text for quick review.
