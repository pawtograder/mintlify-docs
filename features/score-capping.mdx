## Overview

Assignment score capping allows instructors to set a maximum score that students can earn on an assignment, even if they earn more points through bonus questions or extra credit.

## Configuring score caps

Set score caps when creating or editing an assignment:

1. Navigate to **Manage Assignment** → **Edit**
2. Find the **Score Capping** section
3. Enable score capping
4. Set the maximum score (cap)
5. Save the assignment

## How score capping works

### Without score capping
- Student earns 110/100 points
- Final score: 110/100 (110%)

### With score capping (cap at 100)
- Student earns 110/100 points
- Final score: 100/100 (100%)
- Extra 10 points are not counted

## Use cases

### Bonus questions
Offer bonus questions worth extra points while ensuring:
- Students can't exceed 100% on the assignment
- Bonus points help students who missed points elsewhere
- Grade calculations remain consistent

### Extra credit opportunities
Provide extra credit options:
- Allow students to recover from mistakes
- Reward extra effort
- Maintain fair grading across all students

### Flexible grading
- Set total possible points higher than the cap
- Give students multiple paths to full credit
- Reduce impact of individual question mistakes

## Examples

### Example 1: Bonus questions
- Assignment worth 100 points
- Includes 20 points of bonus questions
- Score cap set to 100 points
- Students can miss 20 points and still get 100%

### Example 2: Extra credit
- Assignment worth 80 points
- Extra credit worth 30 points
- Score cap set to 100 points
- Students can earn up to 100% total

### Example 3: Flexible grading
- Assignment worth 120 points
- Score cap set to 100 points
- Students have multiple ways to earn full credit
- Reduces stress about individual mistakes

## Gradebook integration

Score capping integrates with the gradebook:
- Capped scores are displayed in the gradebook
- Original scores are preserved for instructor reference
- Grade calculations use capped scores
- Export includes both original and capped scores

## Best practices

- Communicate score capping policies clearly to students
- Explain how bonus points work with score caps
- Use score caps consistently across similar assignments
- Consider student motivation when setting caps
- Document your score capping rationale
