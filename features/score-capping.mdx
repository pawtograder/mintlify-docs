title: Assignment score capping
description: Set maximum score limits to prevent extra credit inflation
---

## Overview

Score capping allows instructors to set a maximum score limit for assignments, preventing students from earning unlimited extra credit points.

## Configuring score caps

### Assignment settings

1. Edit assignment configuration
2. Locate "Score Cap" setting
3. Enter maximum allowed score
4. Save changes

### Cap behavior

When a score cap is set:

- Student scores cannot exceed the cap
- Autograder may award more points
- Final grade is capped at maximum
- Students see both raw and capped scores

## Example scenarios

### Extra credit with limits

Assignment worth 100 points with 20 points extra credit:

- **Without cap**: Students can earn up to 120/100
- **With cap at 100**: Maximum score is 100/100
- **With cap at 110**: Maximum score is 110/100

### Preventing grade inflation

For assignments with bonus tests:

1. Set base points: 100
2. Add bonus tests: +30 points possible
3. Set score cap: 105
4. Students can earn up to 105/100 (5% bonus)

## How capping works

### Score calculation

```
Raw Score = Sum of all test points earned
Capped Score = min(Raw Score, Score Cap)
Final Grade = Capped Score
```

### Display to students

Students see:

- **Raw score**: Actual points earned (e.g., 115)
- **Capped score**: Applied maximum (e.g., 100)
- **Indicator**: "Score capped at 100" message

### Gradebook integration

The gradebook uses capped scores:

- Exports show capped values
- Grade calculations use caps
- Analytics reflect capped scores

## Use cases

### Limiting extra credit

Prevent excessive extra credit from skewing grades:

- Set reasonable bonus limits
- Maintain grade distribution
- Ensure fairness across assignments

### Standardizing scores

When combining assignments with different point values:

- Cap all assignments at 100
- Simplifies weighted grade calculations
- Consistent scale across assignments

### Encouraging completion

Offer extra credit for early submission:

- Base assignment: 100 points
- Early submission bonus: +10 points
- Cap at 105 to limit advantage

## Removing score caps

To remove a cap:

1. Edit assignment settings
2. Clear the score cap field
3. Save changes
4. Scores recalculate without cap

## Permissions

- **Instructors**: Set and modify score caps
- **Graders**: View caps, cannot modify
- **Students**: See capped scores

## Best practices

- Set caps before students submit
- Communicate cap policy in assignment description
- Use caps consistently across similar assignments
- Consider caps when designing extra credit
- Document cap rationale for transparency
