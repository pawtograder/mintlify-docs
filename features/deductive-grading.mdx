title: Deductive grading
description: Use deduction-only scoring mode for rubric criteria
---

## Overview

Deductive grading allows instructors to create rubric criteria that only deduct points from a total score, rather than awarding points. This is useful for style guides, formatting requirements, and penalty-based grading.

## How deductive grading works

### Traditional grading
- Start at 0 points
- Award points for correct elements
- Final score is sum of awarded points

### Deductive grading
- Start at maximum points
- Deduct points for errors or missing elements
- Final score is maximum minus deductions

## Creating deductive rubric criteria

When creating or editing a rubric:

1. Add a new rubric criterion
2. Select **Deduction-only scoring mode**
3. Set the maximum points for the criterion
4. Define deduction levels:
   - No deduction (0 points deducted)
   - Minor issues (-2 points)
   - Major issues (-5 points)
   - Critical issues (-10 points)

## Use cases

### Code style and formatting
- Start with full style points
- Deduct for style violations
- Deduct for formatting issues
- Deduct for naming convention violations

### Documentation requirements
- Start with full documentation points
- Deduct for missing comments
- Deduct for unclear documentation
- Deduct for incomplete README

### Best practices violations
- Start with full points
- Deduct for inefficient code
- Deduct for poor design choices
- Deduct for security issues

## Example rubric with deductive grading

### Assignment: Web Application (100 points)

**Functionality (70 points)** - Traditional scoring
- Login system (20 points)
- User dashboard (25 points)
- Data persistence (25 points)

**Code Style (15 points)** - Deductive scoring
- Start with 15 points
- Deduct 1 point per style violation (max -5)
- Deduct 2 points for inconsistent naming (max -4)
- Deduct 3 points for missing comments (max -6)

**Documentation (15 points)** - Deductive scoring
- Start with 15 points
- Deduct 5 points for missing README
- Deduct 3 points for incomplete setup instructions
- Deduct 2 points per missing function comment (max -7)

## Configuring deductive criteria

### YAML configuration

```yaml
rubric:
  - name: Code Style
    points: 15
    scoring_mode: deduction_only
    criteria:
      - description: Style violations
        deduction: -1
        max_deductions: 5
      - description: Inconsistent naming
        deduction: -2
        max_deductions: 4
      - description: Missing comments
        deduction: -3
        max_deductions: 6
```

### UI configuration

1. Navigate to **Manage Assignment** → **Rubric**
2. Add a new criterion
3. Enable **Deduction-only mode**
4. Set maximum points
5. Add deduction levels with negative point values
6. Set maximum deductions for each type

## Combining scoring modes

You can mix traditional and deductive scoring in the same rubric:
- Use traditional scoring for core functionality
- Use deductive scoring for style and best practices
- Calculate final score as: (traditional points) + (max deductive points - deductions)

## Best practices

- Clearly communicate which criteria use deductive scoring
- Set reasonable maximum deductions
- Provide examples of what triggers deductions
- Be consistent in applying deductions
- Consider using deductive scoring for subjective criteria
- Document your deduction policies in the assignment description

## Gradebook integration

Deductive criteria integrate seamlessly with the gradebook:
- Display starting points and deductions
- Show final score after deductions
- Export includes deduction details
- Students see what points were deducted and why
