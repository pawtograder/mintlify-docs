## Deductive grading

Create rubric criteria that only deduct points, useful for penalty-based grading schemes.

### How it works

- Students start at 0 points for deduction-only criteria
- Points can only be deducted (negative values)
- Deductions are capped at the criterion's total_points value
- Cannot be combined with additive scoring on the same criterion

### YAML configuration

```yaml
- name: Deduction-only penalties
  description: Penalty-only grading for violations
  is_additive: false
  is_deduction_only: true
  total_points: 20
  checks:
    - name: Late submission
      description: Deduct points for late submissions
      points: 5
      student_visibility: always
    - name: Missing required file
      description: Deduct points if required files are missing
      points: 10
      student_visibility: always
```

### UI display

Deduction-only criteria display as `-X/Y` in the rubric sidebar, showing current deductions out of maximum possible deductions.

## Score capping

Automatically cap final submission scores to the assignment's maximum points.

### Enabling score capping

Set `cap_score_to_assignment_points: true` in your rubric YAML:

```yaml
name: Grading rubric
description: Main grading rubric with score capping
cap_score_to_assignment_points: true
parts:
  - name: Implementation
    # ... criteria
```

### Behavior

- Final score = MIN(manual_score + autograder_score + tweak, assignment_max_points)
- Useful when manual grading serves as a fallback for autograder failures
- Prevents scores from exceeding assignment maximum
- Applied after all scoring calculations including tweaks

### UI indicators

When score capping is enabled:

- Rubric editor shows "Score capping is enabled" message
- Student submission view displays capping notice
- Grading summary explains the cap behavior

## Lab leader grading assignments

Bulk assign reviews to lab section leaders for their respective students.

### Assignment mode

Select "Assign to lab leaders" when creating grading assignments:

- Automatically assigns reviews to lab section leaders
- Each leader reviews only their own lab section's students
- Prevents duplicate assignments for students in multiple sections

### Requirements

- Lab sections must be configured with designated leaders
- Students must be assigned to lab sections
- Works with both individual and group submissions

## Extended due date selection

Choose specific target dates for deadline extensions instead of entering hours and minutes.

### Target date picker

- Select a specific date and time for the new due date
- Automatically calculates hours and minutes extension
- Bidirectional sync: change either target date or hours/minutes
- Timezone-aware using course timezone settings

### Validation

- Target date must be after the current due date
- Minimum extension of 1 minute required
- Clear error messages for invalid selections

### Usage

1. Navigate to assignment due date exceptions
2. Select student or group
3. Either:
   - Choose a target due date from the datetime picker, or
   - Enter hours and minutes manually
4. The other field updates automatically
5. Submit to apply the extension
