## Overview

Error pins automatically detect when students encounter common errors in their submissions and suggest relevant discussion posts that may help them resolve the issue.

## How error pins work

### Automatic detection
When a student's submission fails:
1. The system analyzes the error message
2. Matches the error against known patterns
3. Finds relevant discussion posts about similar errors
4. Displays suggested posts to the student

### Error matching
Error pins match based on:
- Error message text
- Test case names
- Stack traces
- Common error patterns

## Creating error pins

Instructors can create error pins to link errors to discussion posts:

1. Navigate to **Manage Assignment** → **Test Insights**
2. Find a common error in the error analysis
3. Click **Create Error Pin**
4. Select or create a discussion post to link
5. Configure the error matching criteria

### Error pin configuration
- **Error pattern**: Text or regex to match in error messages
- **Test case**: Specific test case that triggers the pin
- **Discussion post**: The post to suggest to students
- **Priority**: Order in which pins are displayed

## Student experience

When a student encounters a pinned error:
1. They see their submission results
2. An "Error Pin" callout appears
3. The callout suggests relevant discussion posts
4. Students can click to view the suggested posts
5. Posts may contain hints, explanations, or solutions

## Managing error pins

### View all error pins
Navigate to **Manage Assignment** → **Error Pins** to:
- See all active error pins
- Edit existing pins
- Delete outdated pins
- View pin usage statistics

### Pin analytics
Track error pin effectiveness:
- How many students see each pin
- Click-through rates to discussion posts
- Whether students resolve errors after viewing pins
- Most helpful pins

## Best practices

### Create pins for common errors
- Monitor test insights for frequently failing tests
- Create pins for errors that affect many students
- Update pins as you learn what helps students

### Write helpful discussion posts
- Explain the error clearly
- Provide hints without giving away the solution
- Include examples of correct approaches
- Link to relevant course materials

### Maintain pins over time
- Update pins when assignment requirements change
- Remove pins for errors that no longer occur
- Refine error matching patterns based on effectiveness
- Add new pins as new error patterns emerge

## Integration with test insights

Error pins integrate with the test insights dashboard:
- Identify common errors automatically
- Suggest creating pins for high-frequency errors
- Track which errors have pins and which don't
- Measure impact of pins on student success

## Example error pin

**Error pattern**: `NullPointerException at line 42`

**Suggested discussion post**: "Common NullPointerException in Assignment 3"

**Post content**:
> Many students are encountering a NullPointerException on line 42. This usually happens when you forget to initialize the `data` variable before using it. Check that you're calling the constructor properly and that all instance variables are initialized.
