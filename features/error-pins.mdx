description: Link common errors to discussion posts to help students debug issues

## Overview

Error pins automatically suggest relevant discussion posts when students encounter specific errors in their submissions. This helps students find solutions faster and reduces repetitive questions.

## How error pins work

### For instructors

1. Identify common error patterns in test insights
2. Create or find a discussion post explaining the solution
3. Create an error pin linking the error to the post
4. Students encountering the error see the discussion link

### For students

When viewing submission results:

- Error pins appear as callouts on failed tests
- Click the link to view the discussion post
- Find explanations and solutions
- Reduce time spent debugging

## Creating error pins

### From test insights dashboard

1. Navigate to Test Insights → Common Errors tab
2. Find an error pattern affecting multiple students
3. Click "Create Error Pin"
4. Search for relevant discussion thread
5. Select the thread and create the pin

### Manual creation

1. Go to assignment management
2. Navigate to "Error Pins" section
3. Click "Create Error Pin"
4. Define matching rules
5. Link to discussion thread

## Error matching rules

### Rule types

Error pins match submissions using:

- **Test name**: Exact test case name
- **Test part**: Specific test part
- **Test output**: Student-visible error message
- **Hidden output**: Instructor-only output
- **Score range**: Specific score thresholds
- **Lint output**: Linting error messages

### Match types

- **Contains**: Text appears anywhere in output
- **Equals**: Exact match required
- **Regex**: Pattern matching with regular expressions
- **Range**: Score within min/max bounds

### Rule logic

Combine multiple rules with:

- **AND logic**: All rules must match
- **OR logic**: Any rule can match

## Example error pins

### Null pointer exception

**Rules:**
- Test name equals "testArrayProcessing"
- Test output contains "NullPointerException"

**Discussion link:** "Common null pointer errors in array processing"

### Off-by-one errors

**Rules:**
- Test name contains "Loop"
- Test output contains "ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException"

**Discussion link:** "Debugging off-by-one errors in loops"

### Compilation errors

**Rules:**
- Lint failed equals true
- Lint output contains "cannot find symbol"

**Discussion link:** "Understanding Java compilation errors"

## Managing error pins

### Viewing active pins

See all error pins for an assignment:

- Pin ID and creation date
- Linked discussion thread
- Number of matched submissions
- Enable/disable status

### Editing pins

Modify existing error pins:

- Update matching rules
- Change linked discussion
- Adjust rule logic (AND/OR)
- Enable or disable pin

### Deleting pins

Remove error pins that are no longer relevant:

- Deletes the pin configuration
- Removes matches from submissions
- Does not delete the discussion post

## Error pin matches

### Automatic matching

When a submission is graded:

- System evaluates all active error pins
- Matches are created for applicable pins
- Students see pins on submission results page

### Match display

Students see error pins as:

- Highlighted callout boxes
- Icon indicating suggested discussion
- Link to the discussion thread
- Brief description of the error

## Analytics

### Pin effectiveness

Track error pin usage:

- Number of submissions matched
- Click-through rate to discussions
- Student engagement with linked posts
- Reduction in duplicate questions

### Common errors report

View which errors affect the most students:

- Sort by occurrence count
- Filter by test name or part
- Identify patterns across submissions

## Permissions

- **Instructors**: Create, edit, delete error pins
- **Graders**: View error pins and matches
- **Students**: See error pins on their submissions

## Best practices

- Create pins for errors affecting 3+ students
- Link to detailed discussion posts with solutions
- Use specific matching rules to avoid false positives
- Test pins on sample submissions before enabling
- Update pins when assignment changes
- Disable outdated pins rather than deleting
- Monitor pin effectiveness in analytics

## Integration with test insights

Error pins work seamlessly with test insights:

1. Test insights identifies common errors
2. One-click error pin creation from error groups
3. Automatic rule generation from error patterns
4. Pre-populated with sample outputs
5. Immediate matching on existing submissions
