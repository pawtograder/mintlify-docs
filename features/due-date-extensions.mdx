## Overview

Instructors can now grant due date extensions by selecting a specific extended due date, rather than entering hours and minutes of extension time.

## How it works

### Previous behavior

Instructors entered extension duration:

- Hours: `48`
- Minutes: `30`
- System calculated: Original due date + 48h 30m

### New behavior

Instructors select the extended due date directly:

- Choose date and time from calendar picker
- See the extension duration calculated automatically
- More intuitive for complex extension scenarios

## Granting extensions

### Individual student extensions

1. Navigate to "Due Date Extensions" in course management
2. Click "Add Extension"
3. Select the student
4. Choose the assignment
5. Pick the extended due date from calendar
6. Save the extension

### Bulk extensions

For multiple students:

1. Select students from the roster
2. Choose assignment
3. Set extended due date
4. Apply to all selected students

## Extension types

### Assignment-specific extensions

Grant extensions for individual assignments:

- Select specific assignment
- Set custom due date per student
- Overrides default due date

### Course-wide extensions

Apply extensions across all assignments:

- Useful for students with accommodations
- Set percentage-based extensions
- Automatically applies to future assignments

## Late tokens

Students can use late tokens for self-service extensions:

### Instructor configuration

1. Set late token policy in course settings
2. Define token value (hours per token)
3. Distribute tokens to students
4. Students redeem tokens for extensions

### Student usage

Students can:

- View available late tokens
- Redeem tokens before due date
- See extended due date after redemption
- Track remaining token balance

## Viewing extensions

### Extension dashboard

View all active extensions:

- Filter by student, assignment, or section
- See original and extended due dates
- Calculate total extension duration
- Export extension report

### Student view

Students see their extended due dates:

- Assignment list shows custom due dates
- Countdown timer reflects extension
- Submission interface displays extended deadline

## Extension validation

The system enforces:

- Extended date must be after original due date
- Cannot extend past course end date
- Late token redemption before deadline
- Sufficient token balance for redemption

## Permissions

- **Instructors**: Grant any extension
- **Graders**: View extensions, cannot modify
- **Students**: Redeem late tokens only

## Best practices

- Set clear late token policies in syllabus
- Grant extensions before students submit
- Document extension reasons for records
- Use bulk extensions for class-wide events
- Monitor extension usage in dashboard
