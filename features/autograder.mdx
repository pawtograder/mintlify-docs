## What-if grading

Test different autograder versions without affecting official student scores.

### Overview

What-if grading allows you to:

- Rerun the autograder using a specific commit SHA
- Test autograder changes before deploying to students
- Compare results across different grader versions
- Promote what-if results to official scores when ready

### How to use

<Steps>
<Step title="Select autograder version">
  Navigate to assignment → Rerun Autograder and choose:
  - A commit from the dropdown (shows last 50 main branch commits)
  - Enter a custom SHA manually
  - Leave empty to use latest on main (default)
</Step>

<Step title="Configure auto-promote">
  Toggle "Auto-promote new result to official":
  - **On**: What-if result immediately becomes the official score
  - **Off**: Result stored separately, can be promoted manually later
</Step>

<Step title="Select submissions">
  Check the submissions you want to regrade and click "Rerun Autograder"
</Step>

<Step title="View results">
  What-if results appear in dedicated columns:
  - What-if Score
  - What-if Grader SHA
  - What-if History (view all what-if runs)
  - Promote button (if auto-promote was off)
</Step>
</Steps>

### What-if history

View all what-if grading attempts for a submission:

- Click "View" in the What-if History column
- See all previous what-if runs with dates, scores, and SHAs
- Compare results across different grader versions

### Promoting results

If auto-promote is disabled:

1. Review what-if results in the table
2. Click "Promote" next to the desired result
3. The what-if result becomes the official autograder score
4. Previous official result is replaced

<Warning>
Promoting a what-if result deletes the previous official grader result and all associated data (test outputs, artifacts).
</Warning>

### Technical details

- What-if runs create new grader_results with `rerun_for_submission_id` set
- No new submissions are created (reuses existing submission)
- What-if results are excluded from grade calculations until promoted
- Repository check runs track the requested grader SHA

## Enhanced autograder reruns

Improvements to the autograder rerun workflow:

### Key changes

- **Reuses existing submissions** instead of creating new ones
- **Instructor selects grader version** via commit picker or manual SHA
- **Auto-promote toggle** for immediate or deferred score updates
- **What-if columns** show pending results before promotion

### Commit selection

The commit picker shows:

- Last 50 commits from the main branch
- Commit SHA (short form)
- Commit message subject line
- Author and date information

### Development autograder columns

Toggle "Show development autograder columns" to view:

- Regression test scores
- Regression test grader SHAs
- Development autograder metadata

These columns are hidden by default to reduce clutter.

### Workflow

1. Instructor selects submissions to regrade
2. Chooses autograder version (optional)
3. Configures auto-promote setting
4. Clicks "Rerun Autograder"
5. System enqueues grading jobs
6. Results appear in what-if columns
7. Instructor promotes results if auto-promote was off

### Benefits

- Test grader changes safely
- No duplicate submissions cluttering the database
- Clear separation between official and experimental scores
- Flexible promotion workflow
