## Overview

The karma system rewards students for helpful contributions to discussion boards. Instructors can award karma points to recognize quality posts, helpful answers, and active participation.

## How karma works

Karma points are awarded by instructors and teaching staff to students who:
- Provide helpful answers to other students' questions
- Create high-quality discussion posts
- Actively participate in course discussions
- Demonstrate understanding through explanations

## Awarding karma

Instructors can award karma points directly from discussion threads:

1. Navigate to a discussion post
2. Click the karma badge or award button
3. Enter the number of karma points to award
4. Add an optional note explaining why karma was awarded

## Viewing karma

Students can view their karma points on:
- Their profile page
- The discussion board leaderboard
- Individual discussion posts where they received karma

## Best practices

- Award karma consistently to encourage participation
- Use karma to recognize both correct answers and helpful explanations
- Consider setting karma goals or milestones for students
- Make karma criteria clear to students at the start of the course

## Configuration

Instructors can configure karma settings in the course management dashboard:
- Enable or disable karma for the course
- Set karma point values for different types of contributions
- Configure karma visibility settings
