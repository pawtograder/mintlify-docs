## Overview

The discussion karma system rewards students for meaningful participation in course discussions. Students earn karma when their posts receive likes from peers and instructors, encouraging quality contributions.

## Karma badges

Students display karma badges next to their names in discussion threads. The badge design evolves as students earn more karma:

- **0 karma**: Green sprout icon (new member)
- **1-10 karma**: Heart icon with count
- **11-49 karma**: Blue star icon with count
- **50+ karma**: Gold trophy icon with count

## Like system

Students and instructors can like discussion posts and replies:

- Click the heart icon to like/unlike a post
- Like counts display next to each post
- Replies are sorted by like count (most liked first)
- Visibility changes sync across all replies in a thread

## Discussion engagement dashboard

Instructors can view comprehensive engagement analytics at `/course/{course_id}/manage/discussion-engagement`:
