## Overview

The discussion karma system gamifies student participation by tracking likes received on discussion posts and displaying karma badges next to usernames.

## Karma badges

Students earn karma badges based on the number of likes their posts receive:

- **Sprout** (0 karma): New member badge for students who haven't received likes yet
- **Heart** (1-10 karma): Basic engagement level with heart icon and count
- **Star** (11-49 karma): Active contributor with blue star badge
- **Trophy** (50+ karma): Top contributor with gold trophy badge

Karma badges appear next to usernames throughout the discussion interface.

## Like functionality

Students and instructors can like discussion posts and replies:

- Click the heart icon to like/unlike a post
- Like counts update in real-time
- Likes contribute to the author's karma score
- Replies are sorted by like count (most liked first)

## Discussion engagement dashboard

Instructors and graders can access the Discussion Engagement page to view:

### Summary statistics

- Total students participating
- Average karma across all students
- Total discussion activity (posts + replies)
- Most active student with trophy icon

### Engagement table

The engagement table displays for each student:

- Current rank and karma badge
- Total karma (likes received)
- Number of posts created
- Number of replies posted
- Likes received
- Likes given to others
- Total activity count

### CSV export

Export engagement data to CSV for further analysis or grade book integration. The export includes all metrics shown in the table.

## Access control
