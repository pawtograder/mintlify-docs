title: Lab leader bulk grading
description: Automatically assign reviews to lab section leaders for their students
---

## Overview

The lab leader bulk grading mode automatically assigns peer reviews to lab section leaders, ensuring each leader grades only their own lab section's students.

## Assignment modes

### Standard modes

- **Manual assignment**: Instructors assign reviews individually
- **Random assignment**: System randomly distributes reviews
- **Round-robin**: Balanced distribution across graders

### Lab leader mode (new)

- **Assign to lab leaders**: Automatically assigns to lab section leaders
- Each lab leader grades their own section's students
- Respects lab section boundaries
- Prevents cross-section assignments

## Setting up lab leader grading

### Prerequisites

1. Create lab sections in course settings
2. Assign students to lab sections
3. Designate lab leaders (graders) for each section
4. Create a peer review assignment

### Enabling lab leader mode

1. Navigate to assignment review settings
2. Select "Assign to lab leaders" mode
3. Configure reviews per student
4. Click "Bulk Assign Reviews"

## How assignments work

### Automatic distribution

The system:

1. Groups students by lab section
2. Identifies the lab leader for each section
3. Assigns all students in a section to that section's leader
4. Creates review assignments automatically

### Assignment rules

- Lab leaders only grade their own section
- Students without lab sections are unassigned
- Multiple lab leaders per section split the load
- Respects grading conflict settings

## Lab section management

### Creating lab sections

1. Go to "Lab Sections" in course management
2. Click "Create Lab Section"
3. Set section name and meeting time
4. Assign lab leader(s)
5. Add students to section

### Assigning lab leaders

Lab leaders must have the "grader" role:

1. Enroll user as grader
2. Assign to lab section as leader
3. Leader can now receive review assignments

## Grading workflow

### For lab leaders

1. Receive automatic review assignments
2. View assigned submissions from their section
3. Complete reviews using rubric
4. Submit grades for their students

### For instructors

1. Monitor review completion across sections
2. View grading progress by lab section
3. Reassign reviews if needed
4. Release grades when all sections complete

## Handling edge cases

### Students without lab sections

Students not assigned to a lab section:

- Do not receive automatic assignments
- Instructors must manually assign reviews
- Shows warning in assignment interface

### Lab leaders with no students

If a lab section has no students:

- Lab leader receives no assignments
- No error or warning generated
- Can manually assign reviews if needed

### Multiple lab leaders per section

When a section has multiple leaders:

- Reviews distribute evenly among leaders
- Round-robin within the section
- Maintains section boundaries

## Viewing assignments

### By lab section

Filter review assignments by lab section:

- See all reviews for a specific section
- Track completion rates per section
- Identify sections needing attention

### By lab leader

View assignments for each lab leader:

- Total reviews assigned
- Completed vs pending
- Average grading time
- Submission links

## Permissions

- **Instructors**: Configure lab leader mode, view all assignments
- **Lab leaders**: Grade assigned students from their section
- **Students**: View their assigned reviewers

## Best practices

- Assign students to lab sections early in semester
- Designate reliable graders as lab leaders
- Use lab leader mode for large courses
- Monitor completion rates by section
- Provide grading guidelines to lab leaders
- Set clear deadlines for review completion

## Troubleshooting

### Reviews not assigned

Check that:

- Students are assigned to lab sections
- Lab sections have designated leaders
- Leaders have grader role enabled
- No grading conflicts exist

### Uneven distribution

If some lab leaders have many more reviews:

- Check lab section enrollment numbers
- Rebalance students across sections
- Add additional lab leaders to large sections

### Missing assignments

If students don't have reviewers:

- Verify lab section assignment
- Check for grading conflicts
- Manually assign if needed
