title: Bulk grading assignment for lab leaders
description: Automatically assign reviews to lab section leaders for their students
---

## Overview

The bulk grading assignment feature for lab leaders automatically assigns review tasks to lab section leaders, ensuring that each leader grades only their own students' submissions.

## How it works

### Assignment mode: Assign to lab leaders

When creating a bulk review assignment:
1. Select **Assign to lab leaders** mode
2. The system automatically:
   - Identifies all lab section leaders
   - Assigns each leader to grade their own students
   - Distributes workload evenly within each section
   - Prevents conflicts of interest

## Setting up lab leader assignments

### Prerequisites
- Lab sections must be configured
- Lab leaders must be assigned to sections
- Students must be enrolled in lab sections

### Creating the assignment

1. Navigate to **Manage Assignment** → **Reviews** → **Bulk Assign**
2. Select **Assign to lab leaders** mode
3. Configure assignment settings:
   - Number of reviews per submission
   - Due date for reviews
   - Grading rubric
4. Click **Create Assignments**

## Lab leader assignment rules

### Automatic assignment
- Each lab leader grades only their own section's students
- Workload is distributed evenly among leaders
- No leader grades their own submission (if they're also a student)
- Conflicts are automatically detected and resolved

### Assignment distribution
- Leaders with more students get more grading assignments
- System balances workload across all leaders
- Ensures each submission gets the required number of reviews

## Managing lab leader assignments

### View assignments
Navigate to **Manage Assignment** → **Reviews** to see:
- Which leader is assigned to which submissions
- Grading progress by lab section
- Completed vs. pending reviews
- Average grading time by section

### Reassign if needed
If a lab leader is unavailable:
1. Select their assignments
2. Click **Reassign**
3. Choose a different lab leader
4. Confirm reassignment

### Monitor progress
Track grading progress:
- By lab section
- By individual leader
- Overall completion rate
- Average time to complete reviews
