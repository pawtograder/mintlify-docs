## Overview

The assignment leaderboard feature allows instructors to create competitive leaderboards that display student rankings based on assignment scores, encouraging engagement and friendly competition.

## Enabling leaderboards

Configure leaderboard settings for each assignment:

1. Navigate to **Manage Assignment** → **Edit**
2. Enable the leaderboard option
3. Configure leaderboard settings:
   - Display top N students
   - Show scores or just rankings
   - Anonymous or named leaderboard
   - Update frequency

## Leaderboard display

Students can view the leaderboard on the assignment page:
- Current rankings
- Their own position
- Score or ranking of top performers
- Updates after each submission (if configured)

## Leaderboard types

### Public leaderboard
- Shows student names and scores
- Visible to all students in the course
- Encourages friendly competition

### Anonymous leaderboard
- Shows rankings without names
- Students can see their own position
- Reduces pressure while maintaining competition

### Top performers only
- Displays only the top N students
- Motivates students to reach the top
- Reduces pressure on lower-performing students

## Configuration options

### Scoring criteria

## Best practices

- Use leaderboards for appropriate assignments
- Consider anonymous leaderboards to reduce pressure
- Communicate leaderboard policies clearly
- Monitor for negative impacts on student wellbeing
- Use leaderboards to encourage, not discourage
- Consider offering small incentives for top performers
