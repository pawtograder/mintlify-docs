description: Search submission files for security violations and academic integrity concerns
---

## Overview

The security audit dashboard helps instructors detect potential academic integrity violations by searching all submission files for specific patterns, such as prohibited library usage or attempts to access grading infrastructure.

## Accessing the dashboard

Navigate to `/course/{course_id}/manage/assignments/{assignment_id}/security`

<Warning>
This feature is instructor-only. Graders and students cannot access the security audit dashboard.
</Warning>

## Searching submissions

### Basic search

1. Enter a search term in the search input
2. Click "Search All Submissions" or press Enter
3. Results display with contextual snippets showing matches

### Search features

- **Case-insensitive**: Searches ignore case differences
- **Full content search**: Scans entire file contents
- **Contextual snippets**: Shows surrounding code for each match
- **Line numbers**: Displays exact line where match occurs

### Common search patterns

Search for prohibited imports or file system access:

```
java.io.File
FileInputStream
FileReader
/autograder/
```

## Understanding results

Each result shows:

- **Student name**: Links to their submission
- **Student email**: Contact information
- **Class section**: Student's assigned section
- **Lab section**: Student's lab group
- **Submission #**: Ordinal number with link
- **Score**: Autograder score with color coding
- **File name**: Links to GitHub file at specific line
- **Matched content**: Code snippet showing the match

### Score indicators

- **Green badge**: Full marks (100%)
- **Red badge**: Partial or zero score
- **Gray badge**: Not yet graded

## Viewing grader output

Click "View Output" on any result to see:

- Full autograder score
- Submission details and links
- Instructor-visible grader output
- Link to complete grader results

## Exporting results

### CSV export

Click "Export All to CSV" to download:

- All search results in spreadsheet format
- Student information and scores
- GitHub links for each match
- Search term used for the query

The CSV export includes formula injection protection for safe use in Excel and Google Sheets.

## Submission metadata export

From any submission page, instructors can export complete submission history:

1. Click the export icon in the submission toolbar
2. Downloads a markdown file containing:
   - All submission attempts with metadata
   - Autograder results and test outputs
   - Grading review scores
   - File diffs between submissions
   - Commit messages and GitHub links

## Use cases

### Detecting prohibited libraries

Search for imports students aren't allowed to use:

```
import java.io
import java.nio.file
```

### Finding hardcoded values

Search for suspicious patterns:

```
/autograder/
expected_output
test_cases
```

### Academic integrity review

Identify students who may have:

- Accessed grading infrastructure files
- Used prohibited file I/O operations
- Hardcoded test case outputs
- Shared code with identical patterns

## Best practices

- Run security audits before finalizing grades
- Document findings with exported CSV reports
- Review grader output for context on violations
- Use submission metadata exports for detailed investigation
