title: Enhanced autograder rerun
description: Rerun autograder with version selection and submission reuse
---

## Overview

The enhanced autograder rerun feature allows instructors to re-evaluate existing submissions with different grader versions without creating new submissions.

## Key improvements

### Reuse existing submissions

Previously, rerunning the autograder created a new submission. Now:

- Reruns use the same submission record
- Preserves submission history and ordinal numbers
- Maintains student's original commit SHA
- Updates only the grader results

### Grader version selection

Instructors can choose which version of the autograder to use:

- Select from available grader versions
- Test new grading rubrics on existing submissions
- Compare results across grader versions
- Roll back to previous grader configurations

## How to rerun the autograder

1. Navigate to the assignment management page
2. Go to "Rerun Autograder" section
3. Select target submissions:
   - All submissions
   - Specific students
   - Submissions with certain scores
4. Choose grader version from dropdown
5. Click "Rerun Autograder"

## Use cases

### Testing new grading rubrics

Before deploying a new autograder version:

1. Select a sample of submissions
2. Choose the new grader version
3. Review results without affecting student records
4. Deploy when satisfied with results

### Fixing grader bugs

If you discover a bug in the autograder:

1. Fix the grader code
2. Deploy the new version
3. Rerun affected submissions
4. Students see updated scores automatically

### Adjusting point values

When modifying test point values:

1. Update the grader configuration
2. Rerun all submissions with new version
3. Scores recalculate based on new rubric
4. Gradebook updates automatically

## What gets updated

When you rerun the autograder:

- ✅ Grader results (scores, test outputs)
- ✅ Test case results
- ✅ Lint results
- ✅ Execution time
- ❌ Submission SHA (preserved)
- ❌ Submission ordinal (preserved)
- ❌ Submission timestamp (preserved)

## Permissions

- **Instructors**: Can rerun autograder with any version
- **Graders**: Cannot rerun autograder
- **Students**: Cannot rerun autograder

## Best practices

- Test new grader versions on a small sample first
- Document grader version changes in assignment notes
- Notify students when scores will be recalculated
- Keep previous grader versions available for rollback
