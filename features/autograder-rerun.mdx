## Overview

The enhanced autograder rerun feature allows instructors to regrade submissions using different versions of the autograder without creating new submissions.

## Key improvements

### Reuse existing submissions
- Rerun grading on the same submission
- Preserve original submission timestamp
- Maintain submission history

### Version selection
- Choose which version of the autograder to use
- Test new grading criteria before applying to all students
- Compare results across autograder versions

## How to rerun the autograder

1. Navigate to **Manage Assignment** → **Rerun Autograder**
2. Select the submissions to regrade
3. Choose the autograder version to use
4. Click **Rerun Autograder**

## Use cases

### Testing autograder changes
Before deploying a new autograder version:
1. Select a few sample submissions
2. Rerun with the new autograder version
3. Compare results with previous version
4. Deploy to all submissions if results are correct

### Fixing grading errors
If you discover an error in your autograder:
1. Fix the autograder
2. Select affected submissions
3. Rerun with the corrected version
4. Release updated grades to students

### Adjusting grading criteria
When you need to adjust point values or test cases:
1. Update the autograder configuration
2. Rerun on all submissions
3. Review the new scores
4. Release updated grades

## Best practices

- Test autograder changes on a small sample first
- Communicate with students when regrading
- Document why regrading was necessary
- Review results before releasing to students
