## Key Concepts

### Row-Level Security (RLS)

Pawtograder uses Supabase's Row Level Security to enforce access control at the database level. Each table has policies that determine what data users can read, create, update, or delete based on their role.

### User Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `student` | Can view course content, submit assignments, respond to surveys |
| `grader` | Student permissions plus grading access |
| `instructor` | Full course management access |

### Profiles

Users have both public and private profiles per course:

- **Public Profile**: Visible to other course members (name, avatar)
- **Private Profile**: Internal identifier for submissions and responses
