# Surveys

Pawtograder's surveys feature allows you to provide feedback on courses, assignments, and instructors. Your responses help improve the learning experience for everyone.

## Accessing Surveys

Navigate to the **Surveys** tab in the main navigation menu to see all surveys assigned to your course.

Each survey card displays:

- **Survey title and description**: What the survey is about
- **Due date and time**: When the survey must be completed
- **Current status**: Your progress on the survey (Not Started, In Progress, or Completed)
- **Submission timestamp**: When you submitted (if completed)

## Survey Status Filters

Use the filter buttons at the top of the surveys page to find specific surveys:

| Filter | Shows |
|--------|-------|
| **All** | All surveys regardless of completion status |
| **Available** | Surveys you haven't started or are still working on |
| **Completed** | Surveys you've already submitted |

## Understanding Survey Status

Your progress on each survey is shown with a colored badge:

- **Not Started** (red): You haven't opened this survey yet
- **In Progress** (red): You've started but not submitted the survey
- **Completed** (green): You've successfully submitted your responses

## Taking a Survey

### Starting a New Survey

1. Find a survey with "Not Started" status
2. Click the green **Start Survey** button
3. Read each question carefully
4. Complete all required questions (marked with a red asterisk *)
5. Click **Complete** to submit your responses

### Continuing an In-Progress Survey

If you started a survey but didn't finish:

1. Find the survey with "In Progress" status
2. Click **Continue Survey**
3. Your previous answers will be saved
4. Complete any remaining questions and submit

<Tip>
If the survey allows editing, your responses are automatically saved as you answer questions. You can safely close the browser and return later without losing your work.
</Tip>

## Survey Due Dates

Each survey has a deadline set by your instructor:

- **Active surveys**: Show the due date and time
- **Overdue surveys**: Cannot be submitted after the deadline passes

Make sure to complete surveys before their due date to ensure your responses are recorded.

<Warning>
You cannot submit a survey after the due date has passed. Plan ahead and complete surveys before the deadline.
</Warning>

## Editing Your Responses

Some surveys allow you to edit your responses after submission. When editing is enabled, you'll see a green notification:

> "You can edit your response since editing is allowed for this survey."

**To edit a completed survey:**

1. Click **View Submission** on the survey card
2. Modify any of your responses
3. Click **Complete** to save your changes

**When editing is not allowed**, you'll see a yellow notification:

> "This survey has been submitted and cannot be edited."

Your original responses will be shown in read-only mode.

<Note>
Not all surveys allow editing after submission. Check for the editing notification before assuming you can make changes later.
</Note>

## Viewing Your Submissions

To review what you submitted:

1. Find the survey with "Completed" status
2. Click **View Submission**
3. Your submitted answers will be displayed

If editing is allowed, you can modify your responses from this same page.
