# Office Hours

Pawtograder's office hours feature allows students to request live help from course staff. Student requests go into a queue, and multiple staff members can be working concurrently through that queue, assigning themselves to help students as they become available.

Students are encouraged to make public requests for help, so that other students can also benefit from the discussion.

## Office Hours Queues

Instructors can create multiple office hours queues to provide different types of help. For example, if a class is coordinated across multiple campuses, there may be in-person help queues per-campus, and a cross-network virtual help queue.

## Viewing Open and Solved Help Requests

Particularly when there are many students asking for help at once, it is likely that multiple students have a sufficiently similar question that they could both benefit from the same answer. If someone else already asked a question similar to yours, and you can see that they are about to be helped, you can join that discussion, rather than asking your own question at the end of the queue.

Use the tabs at the top to navigate:

- **My Requests**: View your current and past help requests
- **Browse Queues**: See all open requests and their status

## Requesting Help

Click the **+ New Request** button to submit a help request. The request form includes several helpful features:

### Before You Request Help

When your course has pinned discussion topics, you'll see a **"Before you request help..."** section at the top of the form with relevant discussion topics that might answer your question. The system automatically suggests pinned posts and related discussions from your course. This helps you:

- Find answers without waiting in the queue
- Discover solutions that other students found helpful
- Browse all related posts with the **Show All Related Posts** expander

Click **Browse All Discussion Posts** to search the full discussion board.

<Note>
This section only appears when your course has pinned discussion posts configured by instructors.

### Request Form Fields

<Steps>
<Step title="Select Help Queue">
Choose which help queue to submit your request to (e.g., "TA Pool"). Different queues may be staffed at different times or locations.
</Step>

<Step title="Add Students (Optional)">
If you're working with partners on a group assignment, you can add them to the help request. You are automatically included and cannot be removed.
</Step>

<Step title="Select Template">
Choose a help request template. Templates provide a structured format to ensure you include all necessary information, such as:
- What you're working on
- What you've already tried
- Specific error messages or issues

Templates help TAs understand your problem quickly so they can start helping right away.
</Step>

<Step title="Write Description">
Fill out the help request description following the template prompts. Be specific about:
- The assignment or task you're working on
- Steps you've already taken to solve the problem
- Any error messages or unexpected behavior
</Step>
</Steps>

## After Submitting a Request

Once you submit a help request:

1. **Queue Position**: You'll see your current position in the queue
2. **Status Updates**: The system notifies you when staff assigns themselves to help
3. **Text Chat**: Staff may begin helping via text chat
4. **Video Chat**: When a TA starts a video call, click **Join Video Call** to connect

<Tip>
Your active help request follows you around the site! You'll see status updates and video call notifications even while browsing the discussion board or other pages.
</Tip>

## Help Request Status

Your help request will show different statuses:

- **Waiting**: You're in the queue waiting for a TA
- **In Progress**: A staff member is actively helping you
- **Resolved**: Your request has been marked as complete

After receiving help, you can provide feedback on the assistance you received. This feedback is visible only to instructors and helps improve the office hours experience.
