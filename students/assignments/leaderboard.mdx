# Assignment Leaderboard

Some assignments may include an optional leaderboard feature that displays student rankings based on their autograder scores. Leaderboards add a competitive element to assignments and can motivate students to optimize their solutions.

<Note>
Leaderboards are optional and must be enabled by your instructor for each assignment. Not all assignments will have leaderboards.
</Note>

## Viewing the Leaderboard

If an assignment has a leaderboard enabled, you'll see a **Leaderboard** tab on the assignment page. The leaderboard displays:

- **Rankings**: Your position relative to other students
- **Scores**: Autograder scores for each student
- **Anonymity options**: Depending on instructor settings, leaderboards may show real names or pseudonyms
- **Your position**: Your current rank is highlighted

## How Rankings Work

Leaderboard rankings are based on:

1. **Autograder scores**: Your active submission's autograder score
2. **Submission time**: In case of ties, earlier submissions rank higher
3. **Real-time updates**: Rankings update automatically as students submit new code

## Leaderboard Privacy

Instructors can configure leaderboard privacy settings:

- **Public leaderboards**: All students can see everyone's rankings
- **Anonymous leaderboards**: Students see rankings but not identities
- **Personal view only**: You only see your own rank and score

## Competitive Assignments

Leaderboards are particularly useful for:

- **Optimization challenges**: Assignments where students compete for the fastest or most efficient solution
- **Performance tasks**: Problems where there are multiple correct approaches with varying quality
- **Extra credit opportunities**: Bonus points for top performers

<Tip>
Focus on learning and understanding the material first. Leaderboards are meant to be fun and motivating, not stressful!
</Tip>

## Opting Out

If you prefer not to participate in leaderboards, check with your instructor about opt-out options. Some courses allow students to hide their names from public leaderboards while still tracking their own progress.
