# Assignment Leaderboard

Some assignments may include an optional leaderboard feature that displays student rankings based on assignment scores. The leaderboard adds a competitive element to assignments while maintaining privacy options.

## Viewing the Leaderboard

If your instructor has enabled the leaderboard for an assignment, you'll see a "Leaderboard" tab on the assignment page.

The leaderboard displays:
- **Rankings**: Your position relative to other students
- **Scores**: Current assignment scores (may be based on autograder results)
- **Anonymity options**: Students can choose to appear anonymously or with their name

## Privacy and Participation

The leaderboard is designed to be optional and privacy-conscious:

- Instructors can enable or disable the leaderboard per assignment
- Students can choose whether to display their name or remain anonymous
- The leaderboard is less prominent in the interface to avoid creating pressure
- Participation in the competitive aspect is entirely voluntary

## How Rankings Work

Rankings are typically based on:
- Autograder scores
- Submission timing (if configured by instructor)
- Completion status

<Note>
The leaderboard is meant to be a fun, optional feature. Your grade is not affected by your leaderboard position—it's purely for those who enjoy a competitive element.
</Note>

## Instructor Configuration

Instructors control whether the leaderboard appears for each assignment. If you don't see a leaderboard tab, your instructor has chosen not to enable this feature for the current assignment.
