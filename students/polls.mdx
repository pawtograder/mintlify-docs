# Polls

Polls are a quick and easy way to answer questions during class. Your instructor may use polls to check understanding, gather feedback, or spark discussion.

## Answering Polls

There are two ways to respond to a poll:

### Via QR Code or Link

Your instructor may display a QR code or share a link during class:

1. **Scan the QR code** with your phone camera, or **click the link** provided by your instructor
2. The poll question and answer options will appear
3. Select your answer(s) from the options displayed
4. Click **Submit** to send your response

If the poll does not require login, you can respond immediately without signing in.

### Via the Polls Page

You can also access polls directly from Pawtograder:

1. Navigate to your course in Pawtograder
2. Go to the **Polls** section in the navigation
3. Live polls from your class will be displayed
4. Click **Answer Poll** to open the poll
5. Select your answer(s) and submit

## Login Requirements

Polls can be configured by your instructor to require login or allow anonymous responses:

| Mode | How It Works |
|------|--------------|
| **Login not required** | Scan the QR code or use the link to answer immediately without signing in. Your response is anonymous. |
| **Login required** | You must sign in to Pawtograder before answering. Your response is associated with your student account. |

<Note>
If a poll requires login and you're not signed in, you'll be prompted to log in before you can submit your response.

## Poll Availability

- Polls are only available when your instructor has made them **live**
- Most polls automatically close after **one hour**
- Your instructor may also manually close a poll at any time
- If a poll is closed, you won't be able to submit a response

## Troubleshooting

### "No active polls" message

- Your instructor may not have any polls open right now
- Wait for your instructor to start a new poll
- The page will update automatically when a poll becomes available

### QR code not scanning

- Make sure your camera is focused on the QR code
- Try moving closer or adjusting the angle
- Use the direct URL instead (ask your instructor to display it)

### Login prompt appears

- The poll requires authentication
- Sign in with your Pawtograder credentials
- After signing in, you'll be redirected to the poll

### "Poll is closed" error

- The poll is no longer accepting responses
- This may be because the 1-hour window has passed
- Or your instructor manually closed the poll

## Tips for Students

- **Have your device ready**: When your instructor announces a poll, be ready to scan the QR code quickly
- **Read carefully**: Take a moment to read the question and all options before answering
- **Don't overthink**: Polls are usually meant for quick responses, not extended deliberation
- **Ask questions**: If you don't understand the poll question, ask your instructor for clarification
