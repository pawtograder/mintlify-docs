# Discussion Board

Pawtograder's discussion board feature allows students and staff to discuss course content and ask questions. It is **not** intended to be a replacement for office hours, although there is an option to format the post as a question that needs an answer (as opposed to a "note" that does not need an answer). Posts are formatted as Markdown, and support drag-and-drop attachments and images.

## Discussion Board Layout

The discussion board features a feed-based layout with helpful sidebar widgets:

<Frame>

</Frame>

### Feed Navigation

- **My Feed**: Your personalized view of posts, showing content from topics you follow and posts you've interacted with
- **Browse Topics**: Explore all discussion topics organized by category
- **Followed topics**: Filter to show only posts from categories you're following

### Pinned Posts

The sidebar displays **Pinned Posts**: important threads highlighted by your instructors. These typically include:

- Frequently asked questions
- Important announcements
- Helpful resources and guides

Pinned posts stay visible in the sidebar for quick access, regardless of how many new posts are created.

### Top Posts This Week

The sidebar also shows **Top Posts This Week**, highlighting the most engaging discussions based on community activity.

## Active Help Request Widget

When you have an active help request in office hours, it follows you around the site! A widget appears in the sidebar showing:

- Your current position in the queue
- Status updates (e.g., "Staff is here helping you now!")
- Video call notifications when a TA starts a video chat
- A **Join Video Call** button for instant access

</Frame>

This integration ensures you never miss updates on your help request while browsing discussions or working on other parts of the course.

## Post Visibility and Identity

Posts can be shared with the entire class, or with course staff only. Each user in a class has a pseudonym, and can choose to use their real name or their pseudonym. Staff can always see the real name of a user.

Students can edit their own posts, and staff can edit any post.

## Notifications

By default, users do not get notifications for new posts, but can optionally "watch" a post to receive notifications when the post is updated or receives a new reply. Interacting with a post (e.g. replying to it) will automatically watch the post.

## Creating a New Post

Click the **+ New Post** button in the top right to create a new discussion thread. When creating a post:

1. **Select a topic**: Choose a category to help organize your post
2. **Choose visibility**: Share with the entire class or staff only
3. **Select identity**: Post with your real name or pseudonym
4. **Mark as question or note**: Questions indicate you need an answer; notes are for sharing information
5. **Add images**: Drag and drop images directly into the editor to upload them inline with your content

## Engaging with Posts

Each post displays helpful metadata:

- **Topic tag**: Color-coded category (e.g., "Logistics", "Assignments")
- **Author**: Who created the post
- **Timestamp**: When it was posted
- **Replies**: Number of responses, with "(X new)" indicators for unread replies
- **Likes**: Community engagement—click the heart to show appreciation
- **Answered badge**: Indicates questions that have been resolved

Replies are threaded, allowing for organized conversations. Use the Markdown editor to format your responses with code blocks, links, images, and more.
