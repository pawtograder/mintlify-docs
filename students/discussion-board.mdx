# Discussion Board

Pawtograder's discussion board feature allows students and staff to discuss course content and ask questions. It is **not** intended to be a replacement for office hours, although there is an option to format the post as a question that needs an answer (as opposed to a "note" that does not need an answer). Posts are formatted as markdown, and support drag-and-drop attachments and images.

Posts can be shared with the entire class, or with course staff only. Each user in a class has a pseudonym, and can choose to use their real name or their pseudonym. Staff can always see the real name of a user.

Students can edit their own posts, and staff can edit any post.

By default, users do not get notifications for new posts, but can optionally "watch" a post to receive notifications when the post is updated or receives a new reply. Interacting with a post (e.g. replying to it) will automatically watch the post.

## Posting to the discussion board

Click the "Create a new thread" button to create a new post. Choose a topic to categorize your post, mark it as a question or a note, select the visibility, and choose to post with your real name or your pseudonym.

Replies on posts are threaded, and as with posts, can be posted with your real name or your pseudonym. The editor supports markdown just like the post editor, but defaults to having the preview hidden.
