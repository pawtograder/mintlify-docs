# Office Hours Overview

Pawtograder's office hours feature allows students to request live help from course staff. Student requests go into a queue, and multiple staff members can be working concurrently through that queue, assigning themselves to help students as they become available.

Students are encouraged to make public requests for help, so that other students can also benefit from the discussion.

## Get Help CTA and Help Drawer

Students have access to a persistent **Get Help** call-to-action button throughout the site. This button opens a right-side help drawer that provides:

- **Office Hours status card**: Overview of all available queues and their current status
- **Per-queue cards**: Individual queue information including wait times and staff availability
- **Weekly queue schedule**: Calendar view showing when each queue is staffed, with live "Happening now" highlights for currently active sessions
- **Demo queues**: Optional practice queues for testing (configured via ordinal-based queue ordering)

### Queue Management Features

- **Ordinal-based ordering**: Queues are displayed in a configurable order
- **Course-level description**: Add a description to explain your office hours system
- **Queue name resolution**: Calendar events automatically link to the corresponding queue
- **Conflict detection**: The system validates help requests to prevent scheduling conflicts for solo office hours

## Student Notifications

The platform provides comprehensive notification support to ensure students never miss updates:

### Notification Types

- **Browser notifications**: Desktop alerts for help request updates
- **Title notifications**: Page title updates showing notification counts
- **Sound notifications**: Audio alerts for important events
- **Favicon updates**: Visual indicator in the browser tab
- **Permission warnings**: Clear prompts if browser notifications are blocked

### Notification Settings

Students can:

- Test notifications to verify their setup
- Enable or disable specific notification types
- Configure sound preferences
- Manage browser notification permissions

<Tip>
Encourage students to enable browser notifications during the first week of class to ensure they receive timely updates about their help requests.

## Office Hours Queues

Instructors can create multiple office hours queues to provide different types of help. For example, if a class is coordinated across multiple campuses, there may be in-person help queues per-campus, and a cross-network virtual help queue.

## Help Request Templates

Instructors can create help request templates, which are pre-filled help requests that students can use to request help. This is useful to help prompt students to ensure that they have completed any expected troubleshooting steps before seeking help.

Templates include:
- A template name (e.g., "General help request")
- A description explaining what information students should provide
- Pre-filled placeholder text guiding students to include relevant details

## Pinned Discussion Topics

When students create a new help request and your course has pinned discussion posts, the system automatically displays a **"Before you request help..."** section with pinned discussion topics from the course discussion board. This feature:

- Encourages students to check existing answers before joining the queue
- Surfaces instructor-highlighted posts that address common questions
- Shows related posts with an expandable "Show All Related Posts" option
- Reduces wait times by helping students find answers independently

<Tip>
Pin important FAQ threads and common troubleshooting posts on your discussion board to automatically surface them to students before they request help.

## Providing Help

When a staff member is working on the queue, they should click **Start Working** to indicate that they are available to help. This is a helpful indicator for students, and also allows instructors to see that staff are logged on and ready to help.

Select a help request from the queue, and click **Take Assignment** to indicate that you are actively working on it.

### Text and Video Chat

Staff can communicate with students through:

1. **Text Chat**: Built-in messaging for quick questions and code sharing
2. **Video Chat**: Click **Start Video Chat** to open a video call with screen-sharing capabilities

After the staff member has started the video chat, students can click the **Join Video Chat** button to join. The video chat window opens in a popup.

### Active Help Request Widget

When a student has an active help request, it follows them around the site. They'll see:

- Their current queue position or status
- Notifications when staff assigns to help them
- Video call invitations with a prominent "Join Video Call" button

This ensures students never miss updates, even while browsing the discussion board or other course pages.

## Resolving Requests

A help request can be marked as "Resolved" by either a staff member or a student.

## Feedback and Analytics

After a help request is completed, the student can provide feedback on the help provided. This feedback is visible to instructors only and can be used to:

- Monitor quality of assistance provided
- Identify areas for improvement
- Recognize excellent staff members
