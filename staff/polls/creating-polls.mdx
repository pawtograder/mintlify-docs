</Frame>

4. Select the poll type (see [Poll Types](/staff/polls/poll-types) for options)
5. Enter your question prompt
6. Add answer options (click "Add Choice" to add more)
7. Click **Use This Poll** button to apply your question
8. Optionally, click **Preview Poll** to see how students will see it
9. Configure **Require login to respond** based on your needs
10. Click **Publish Poll** to make it live immediately

## Using the Visual Builder

The visual builder provides an intuitive interface for creating poll questions:

### Question Prompt

Enter the question you want to ask students. Keep it concise so students can read and respond quickly.

### Poll Type Selection

Choose between:
- **Single Choice**: Students select exactly one answer
- **Multiple Choice**: Students can select multiple answers

### Answer Options

- Click **Add Choice** to add answer options
- Each option has a text field for the choice label
- Minimum of 2 options required
- Remove options by clicking the delete icon

### Applying Changes

After configuring your question, click **Use This Poll** to apply it. The JSON configuration will be updated automatically.

## Poll Settings

When creating a poll, you can configure the following:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Question Prompt** | The question displayed to students |
| **Question Type** | Single choice or multiple choice |
| **Choices** | The available response options |
| **Require Login** | Whether students must be logged in to respond |

### Require Login

This setting controls who can respond to your poll:

| Setting | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **Enabled** | Students must log in to Pawtograder to respond. Their identity is recorded. |
| **Disabled** | Anyone with the poll link/QR code can respond anonymously. |

<Tip>
Enable **Require Login** if you want to:
- Track which students participated
- Ensure only enrolled students respond
- Use polls for attendance

Disable it for:
- Quick anonymous feedback
- Low-stakes comprehension checks
- Maximizing response rate (no login friction)
</Tip>

## Automatic Poll Closing

Polls automatically close **one hour** after being published. This ensures that:
- Responses are collected in a timely manner
- Students cannot submit responses long after class has ended
- Results remain relevant to the in-class discussion

<Info>
The one-hour timer starts when you click **Publish Poll**, not when students first respond.
</Info>

## Managing Polls

### Viewing All Polls

The polls management page shows all your polls with filtering options:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/staff/polls/poll-manage.png" alt="Polls Management Page with filter options" />
</Frame>

- **All**: Shows all polls (live and closed)
- **Live**: Shows only currently active polls
- **Closed**: Shows only closed polls

### Opening and Closing Polls

From the poll management view:
- **Open Poll**: Makes a closed poll live again (resets the 1-hour timer)
- **Close Poll**: Manually closes a poll before the automatic timeout

### Viewing Responses

Click on a poll to view its responses and analytics. See [Poll Visualizations](/staff/polls/visualizations) for details on the analytics dashboard.

## Deleting a Poll

To delete a poll:

1. Click the **Delete** button on the poll row
2. Confirm your choice in the dialog

<Frame>

</Frame>

<Warning>
**Deleting a poll permanently removes all student responses.** This action cannot be undone. If you just want to stop collecting responses, close the poll instead.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

### Before Class

- **Prepare questions in advance**: Have your poll questions ready to minimize setup time
- **Test the workflow**: Create a test poll to familiarize yourself with the interface
- **Plan your timing**: Know when during the lecture you'll use each poll

### Question Design

- **Keep questions concise**: Students should be able to read and respond in under 30 seconds
- **Limit answer options**: 3-5 options is typically ideal for quick responses
- **Use clear language**: Avoid ambiguous wording that could confuse students

### During Class

- **Display the QR code**: Project the QR code for easy mobile access
- **Give adequate time**: Allow 30-60 seconds for students to respond
- **Discuss results**: Use poll results to guide class discussion

### After Class

- **Close polls promptly**: If you're done collecting responses, close the poll
- **Review participation**: Check response counts to gauge engagement
- **Iterate**: Adjust your question style based on what gets the best responses
