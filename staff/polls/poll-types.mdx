# Poll Types

Pawtograder supports two poll types to accommodate different polling needs. Each type allows students to respond quickly during class.

## Single Choice

Students select exactly one option from a predefined list. This uses radio button selection.

**Best for:**
- Yes/no or true/false questions
- Questions with one correct answer
- Forced-choice preference questions
- Concept check questions
- A/B/C/D multiple choice exam-style questions

**Configuration:**
- Add 2 or more answer options
- Students can select exactly one option
- Selecting a new option automatically deselects the previous choice

**Example Questions:**
- "Is this code snippet thread-safe?" (Yes / No)
- "What is the time complexity of binary search?" (O(1) / O(log n) / O(n) / O(n log n))
- "Which design pattern is being used here?" (Singleton / Factory / Observer / Strategy)

## Multiple Choice

Students can select one or more options from a predefined list. This uses checkbox selection.

**Best for:**
- "Select all that apply" questions
- Questions where multiple answers may be correct
- Gathering preferences where students may agree with several options
- Identifying common misconceptions (students may have multiple)

**Configuration:**
- Add 2 or more answer options
- Students can select any number of options (including none or all)
- Each option can be independently selected/deselected

**Example Questions:**
- "Which of the following are valid JavaScript variable declarations?" (var x / let y / const z / int w)
- "What topics would you like more review on?" (Arrays / Recursion / Trees / Graphs)
- "Select all sorting algorithms with O(n log n) average case" (Bubble / Merge / Quick / Selection)

## Choosing the Right Poll Type

| Scenario | Recommended Type | Reason |
|----------|------------------|--------|
| True/False question | Single Choice | Only one answer possible |
| "What is the correct answer?" | Single Choice | One correct answer expected |
| "Which do you prefer?" | Single Choice | Forces a decision |
| "Select all that apply" | Multiple Choice | Multiple correct answers |
| "What topics are confusing?" | Multiple Choice | Students may have multiple concerns |
| "Which concepts have you seen before?" | Multiple Choice | Students may recognize several |
| Attendance check | Single Choice | Single "Present" option works |
| Quick comprehension check | Single Choice | Keeps responses simple |

## Response Behavior

### Single Choice

- When a student selects an option, any previous selection is cleared
- The response is stored as a single value
- Results show distribution across options (always totals to 100%)

### Multiple Choice

- Students can toggle options on/off independently
- The response is stored as an array of selected values
- Results show count per option (may exceed 100% when summed)

<Tip>
Use **Single Choice** when you want students to commit to a single answer. Use **Multiple Choice** when the question naturally has multiple valid selections.

## Data Format

Poll responses are stored in JSON format:

**Single Choice Response:**
```json
{
  "poll_question_0": "Option A"
}
```

**Multiple Choice Response:**
```json
{
  "poll_question_0": ["Option A", "Option C"]
}
```

This data is used to generate real-time visualizations on the response dashboard.
