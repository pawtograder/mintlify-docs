# Poll Visualizations

Pawtograder provides real-time visualizations for poll results, making it easy to share results with your class during a lecture.

## Response Dashboard

After creating a poll, you can view results in real-time. The response dashboard includes:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/staff/polls/poll-results.png" alt="Polls Results dashboard with bar chart and QR code" />
</Frame>

### Dashboard Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Header** | Shows poll question, URL, QR code, and controls |
| **Bar Chart** | Visual representation of response distribution |
| **Response Count** | Total number of responses received |
| **Poll URL** | Direct link students can use to respond |
| **QR Code** | Scannable code for quick mobile access |

## Real-Time Updates

The dashboard updates **instantly** as students submit responses:

- No page refresh required
- Bar lengths animate as new responses come in
- Response counts update in real-time
- Works across all connected instructor devices

<Info>
Real-time updates are powered by Supabase's realtime subscriptions. The dashboard subscribes to response changes and updates the UI immediately when new data arrives.

## Bar Chart Visualization

Both single choice and multiple choice polls display results as a horizontal bar chart:

- **Each answer option** is shown as a separate bar
- **Bar length** corresponds to the number of responses for that option
- **Labels** show the option text
- **Counts** display the number of responses per option
- **Colors** distinguish between different options

### Reading the Chart

For **Single Choice** polls:
- The total responses equals the sum of all bars
- Percentages will total 100%

For **Multiple Choice** polls:
- Each bar shows how many students selected that option
- Percentages may exceed 100% (students can select multiple)
- Total responses shows unique students who responded

## QR Code Access

Each poll has a unique QR code that allows students to quickly access and respond from their mobile devices.

### How QR Codes Work

| Feature | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **Class-Specific** | The QR code links to your specific course |
| **Latest Poll** | Always directs to the **newest active poll** |
| **Click to Enlarge** | Click the QR code to view it in a larger modal |

### Using the QR Code in Class

1. Create and publish a new poll
2. Navigate to the poll's response dashboard
3. Click the QR code to enlarge it for projection
4. Students scan with their phone camera
5. They're directed to the current poll and can submit their response

<Note>
If the poll has **Require Login** enabled, students will be prompted to log in before they can submit a response.
</Note>

## Presentation Mode

Presentation mode provides a fullscreen display optimized for classroom projection.

### Entering Presentation Mode

1. Open the poll response dashboard
2. Click the **Present** button in the header
3. The chart expands to fill the entire screen
4. QR code appears in the bottom-right corner for student access

### Presentation Mode Features

- **Fullscreen Display**: Chart fills the entire screen
- **Large QR Code**: Easy to scan from anywhere in the classroom
- **Poll URL**: Displayed at the bottom for manual entry
- **Real-Time Updates**: Chart continues to update live
- **Dark Background**: Optimized for projection visibility

### Exiting Presentation Mode

- Press the **Escape** key
- Click the **Close** button (if visible)

<Tip>
Presentation mode is perfect for:
- Displaying results while students are still responding
- Revealing final results after closing the poll
- Facilitating class discussion around the responses
</Tip>

## Poll Controls

The response dashboard header includes controls for managing the poll:

### Start/Stop Poll

- **Start Poll**: Makes a closed poll live again
  - Resets the 1-hour auto-close timer
  - Students can begin submitting responses
  - Real-time updates activate

- **Stop Poll**: Closes an active poll
  - Stops accepting new responses
  - Existing responses are preserved
  - Results remain viewable

### Poll URL

The poll URL is displayed in the header and can be:
- Copied and shared via chat, email, or LMS
- Projected for students to type manually
- Posted on a class website

Format: `https://pawtograder.com/poll/{course_id}`

## Tips for Effective Presentation

### Before Projecting

- Test the QR code from different distances
- Ensure the projector resolution shows the chart clearly
- Have a backup plan (URL) if QR scanning fails

### During Class

- Allow 30-60 seconds for students to respond
- Watch the response count to know when most students have answered
- Use presentation mode when you want all eyes on the results

### Discussing Results

- Point out the most popular answers
- Ask students to explain their reasoning
- Use surprising results to spark discussion

## Accessibility Considerations

- Bar charts use distinct colors for each option
- Option labels are displayed as text alongside bars
- Response counts are shown numerically
- QR code has sufficient contrast for scanning
- Poll URL provides text-based alternative to QR code
