# Configuring Autograders

<Note>
This documentation is under construction. Check back soon for detailed autograder configuration guides.
</Note>

## Summary of Autograding Architecture

The autograder system uses an "overlay grader" architecture that allows flexible grading configurations.

*Detailed documentation coming soon.*

## Rerunning the Autograder

You can rerun the autograder on existing submissions to apply updated grading logic or fix issues. The enhanced rerun feature provides more control over the regrading process.

### Rerun Options

When rerunning the autograder, you can:

1. **Reuse existing submissions**: The autograder reruns on the same submission without creating a new one
2. **Select grader version**: Choose which version of the grader to use for the rerun
   - Select from recent commits in your grader repository
   - Enter a specific commit SHA manually
   - Use the current active grader version

### How to Rerun

To rerun the autograder on submissions:

1. Navigate to the assignment's autograder page
2. Select the submissions you want to regrade
3. Click the "Rerun Autograder" button
4. In the regrade dialog:
   - Choose a grader version from the commit list, or
   - Enter a specific commit SHA
   - Optionally enable "Auto-promote" to set this version as the active grader

### Auto-Promote Feature

The auto-promote option automatically promotes the selected grader version to be the active grader for all future submissions after the rerun completes successfully. This is useful when:

- You've fixed a bug in the grader and want to apply it going forward
- You've updated test cases and want all new submissions to use them
- You're confident the new grader version should be the default

<Warning>
Rerunning the autograder will replace the existing autograder results for the selected submissions. Make sure you've tested your grader changes before applying them to student submissions.
</Warning>

## Quickstart: Java and Python

Build system integration guides for common programming languages.

*Detailed documentation coming soon.*
