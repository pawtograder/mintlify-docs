# Configuring Autograders

<Note>
This documentation is under construction. Check back soon for detailed autograder configuration guides.
</Note>

## Summary of Autograding Architecture

The autograder system uses an "overlay grader" architecture that allows flexible grading configurations.

*Detailed documentation coming soon.*

## Rerunning the Autograder

Instructors can rerun the autograder on student submissions with enhanced control:

- **Reuse existing submission**: The rerun updates the same submission rather than creating a new one, preserving the submission history
- **Select grader version**: Choose which version of the grader to use for the rerun, allowing you to test grader updates or regrade with corrected test cases

This feature is useful when you need to update test cases, fix grading errors, or apply grader improvements to existing submissions.

## Quickstart: Java and Python

Build system integration guides for common programming languages.

*Detailed documentation coming soon.*
