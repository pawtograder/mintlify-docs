# Configuring Autograders

<Note>
This documentation is under construction. Check back soon for detailed autograder configuration guides.
</Note>

## Summary of Autograding Architecture

The autograder system uses an "overlay grader" architecture that allows flexible grading configurations.

*Detailed documentation coming soon.*

## Rerunning the Autograder

Instructors can rerun the autograder on student submissions when needed. The enhanced rerun feature allows you to:

- Rerun the autograder on the same submission (without creating a new submission)
- Select which version of the grader to use for the rerun
- Preserve the original submission timestamp and metadata

This is useful when you've fixed a bug in the autograder, want to test a new grading configuration, or need to regrade submissions after updating test cases.

## Quickstart: Java and Python

Build system integration guides for common programming languages.

*Detailed documentation coming soon.*
