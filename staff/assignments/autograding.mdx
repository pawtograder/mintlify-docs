# Configuring Autograders

<Note>
This documentation is under construction. Check back soon for detailed autograder configuration guides.
</Note>

## Summary of Autograding Architecture

The autograder system uses an "overlay grader" architecture that allows flexible grading configurations.

*Detailed documentation coming soon.*

## Quickstart: Java and Python

Build system integration guides for common programming languages.

*Detailed documentation coming soon.*

## Rerunning the Autograder

Instructors can rerun the autograder on student submissions when needed. This is useful for:

- Testing autograder changes before applying them to all submissions
- Debugging grading issues
- Updating scores after fixing autograder bugs

### Enhanced Rerun Features

When rerunning the autograder, you can:

- **Reuse the same submission**: The rerun updates the existing submission rather than creating a new one, preserving the submission history and student's active submission status
- **Select grader version**: Choose which version of the grader to use for the rerun, allowing you to test new grader versions or revert to previous versions

This flexibility ensures you can iterate on your autograder configuration without disrupting student submissions or creating confusion with multiple submission entries.
