# Configuring Autograders

<Note>
This documentation is under construction. Check back soon for detailed autograder configuration guides.
</Note>

## Summary of Autograding Architecture

The autograder system uses an "overlay grader" architecture that allows flexible grading configurations.

*Detailed documentation coming soon.*

## Rerunning Autograders

Instructors can rerun the autograder on student submissions when needed. The enhanced rerun feature allows you to:

- **Reuse the same submission**: Rerun the autograder on the existing submission without creating a new one
- **Select grader version**: Choose which version of the grader to use for the rerun, allowing you to test grader updates or revert to previous versions
- **Batch operations**: Rerun autograders on multiple submissions at once

This is useful when:
- You've fixed a bug in the autograder
- You want to apply updated test cases to existing submissions
- You need to verify grading consistency across different grader versions

## Quickstart: Java and Python

Build system integration guides for common programming languages.

*Detailed documentation coming soon.*
