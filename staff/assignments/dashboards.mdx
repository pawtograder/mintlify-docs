# Assignment Dashboards

Pawtograder provides several dashboards to help instructors monitor assignment security, test performance, and overall student progress.

## Assignment Security Dashboard

The **Assignment Security Dashboard** helps instructors identify potential academic integrity issues and unusual submission patterns. Access it from the assignment page to monitor:

- **Submission Patterns**: Identify unusual submission timing or frequency
- **Code Similarity**: Detect potential plagiarism or unauthorized collaboration
- **Repository Activity**: Monitor git commit patterns and repository access
- **Anomaly Detection**: Flag submissions that deviate from expected patterns

This dashboard helps instructors:
- Proactively identify potential academic integrity violations
- Investigate suspicious submission patterns
- Maintain fair assessment practices
- Document evidence for academic integrity cases

<Tip>
Review the security dashboard regularly, especially around assignment due dates when unusual patterns are most likely to occur.

## Test Insights Dashboard

The **Test Insights Dashboard** provides detailed analytics on student performance across test cases. This dashboard shows:

- **Test Case Performance**: Which test cases students are passing or failing most frequently
- **Common Failure Patterns**: Identify which tests are causing the most difficulty
- **Performance Trends**: Track how student performance changes over time
- **Individual vs. Class Performance**: Compare individual student results against class averages

Use this dashboard to:
- Identify concepts that students are struggling with
- Adjust teaching focus based on test failure patterns
- Provide targeted help to students failing specific test cases
- Evaluate whether test cases are appropriately calibrated

<Note>
The Test Insights Dashboard is particularly useful for iterative assignments where students make multiple submissions. It helps you understand which aspects of the assignment are most challenging.

## Assignment Dashboard

The **Assignment Dashboard** provides a high-level overview of assignment progress and completion:

- **Submission Statistics**: Total submissions, active submissions, and completion rates
- **Grading Progress**: Track how many submissions have been graded
- **Due Date Tracking**: Monitor upcoming deadlines and extension requests
- **Group Formation**: View group assignment status for group projects

This dashboard gives instructors a quick snapshot of overall assignment health and helps identify students who may need additional support.
