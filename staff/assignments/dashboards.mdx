# Assignment Dashboards

Pawtograder provides several dashboards to help instructors monitor and analyze assignment data.

## Assignment Security Dashboard

The Assignment Security Dashboard helps instructors identify potential academic integrity issues by tracking:

- **Submission patterns**: Unusual submission timing or frequency
- **Code similarity**: Potential collaboration or copying between students
- **Repository activity**: Suspicious commit patterns or repository access
- **Anomaly detection**: Statistical outliers in submission behavior

This dashboard provides early warning signs that may warrant further investigation, helping maintain academic integrity while respecting student privacy.

## Test Insights Dashboard

The Test Insights Dashboard provides detailed analytics on student performance across test cases:

- **Test pass rates**: Which test cases students struggle with most
- **Performance trends**: How student performance changes over time
- **Common failures**: Patterns in test failures that indicate conceptual misunderstandings
- **Individual vs. class performance**: Compare individual student progress against class averages

Use these insights to:
- Identify topics that need additional instruction
- Adjust assignment difficulty
- Provide targeted help to struggling students
- Recognize areas where students excel

## Assignment Dashboard

The Assignment Dashboard provides a high-level overview of assignment status:

- **Submission statistics**: How many students have submitted
- **Grading progress**: Completion status of grading tasks
- **Due date tracking**: Upcoming deadlines and extensions
- **Score distribution**: Grade distribution across the class

This centralized view helps instructors stay on top of assignment logistics and identify issues that need attention.
