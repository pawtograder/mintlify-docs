# Assignment Dashboards

Pawtograder provides several dashboards to help instructors monitor and manage assignments effectively.

## Assignment Overview Dashboard

The assignment overview dashboard provides a high-level view of assignment progress, showing:

- Submission statistics
- Grading progress
- Student participation metrics
- Due date information

This dashboard helps you quickly assess the overall status of an assignment and identify areas that need attention.

## Grading Status Dashboard

The grading status dashboard tracks the progress of handgrading tasks across your course staff. It displays:

- Number of grading tasks assigned to each grader
- Completion status for each grader
- Overdue grading tasks
- Average time to complete grading

Use this dashboard to:

- Monitor grading workload distribution
- Identify graders who may need support
- Track grading progress toward release deadlines
- Ensure balanced workload across your grading team

## Assignment Security Dashboard

The security dashboard helps you identify potential academic integrity issues by monitoring:

- Suspicious submission patterns
- Unusual autograder behavior
- Potential code sharing indicators
- Submission timing anomalies

This dashboard provides early warning signs that may warrant further investigation, helping you maintain academic integrity in your course.

## Test Insights Dashboard

The test insights dashboard analyzes autograder results to help you understand student performance patterns:

- Test case pass rates across all submissions
- Common failure patterns
- Tests that students find most challenging
- Performance trends over time

Use this dashboard to:

- Identify concepts students are struggling with
- Adjust instruction based on common errors
- Evaluate test case difficulty
- Provide targeted support to students

## Student Leaderboard

Instructors can optionally enable a student leaderboard for assignments. The leaderboard displays:

- Student rankings based on assignment scores
- Autograder performance metrics
- Optional anonymization settings

### Configuring the Leaderboard

The leaderboard feature is optional and can be configured per assignment:

1. Navigate to the assignment settings
2. Enable or disable the leaderboard
3. Choose visibility settings (all students, top performers only, etc.)
4. Select whether to show student names or use anonymous identifiers

The leaderboard can be made less prominent in the interface to reduce competitive pressure while still providing performance feedback.
