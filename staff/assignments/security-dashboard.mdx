# Assignment Security Dashboard

The assignment security dashboard helps you monitor assignment security and identify potential academic integrity concerns. Use this tool to audit submission patterns and detect anomalies that may warrant further investigation.

## Accessing the Security Dashboard

Navigate to an assignment and select the "Security" tab to view the security dashboard.

## Dashboard Features

### Submission Pattern Analysis

The dashboard analyzes submission patterns across all students to identify:

- **Unusual submission timing**: Submissions that occur at unexpected times
- **Similarity patterns**: Groups of submissions with similar characteristics
- **Anomalous behavior**: Deviations from typical student submission patterns

### Security Metrics

Key metrics displayed include:

- **Submission timestamps**: When students submitted their work
- **Repository activity**: Commit patterns and timing
- **File change patterns**: Unusual modifications or additions
- **Access logs**: Repository access history

### Flagged Submissions

The dashboard automatically flags submissions that may warrant review:

- Submissions with unusual patterns
- Multiple submissions from different accounts with similar content
- Suspicious timing or access patterns

## Investigation Tools

When reviewing flagged submissions, you can:

1. **View detailed logs**: Access complete submission and repository history
2. **Compare submissions**: Side-by-side comparison of flagged submissions
3. **Review commit history**: Examine the development timeline
4. **Export data**: Generate reports for academic integrity proceedings

## Best Practices

<Warning>
The security dashboard is a tool to assist in identifying potential issues, not a definitive proof of academic misconduct. Always investigate flagged items thoroughly and follow your institution's academic integrity policies.
</Warning>

- Review flagged submissions promptly
- Consider context when evaluating patterns
- Document your findings for potential follow-up
- Combine dashboard insights with other evidence
- Follow institutional policies for academic integrity cases

## Privacy and Compliance

The security dashboard:
- Only displays data to authorized course staff
- Maintains audit logs of dashboard access
- Complies with student privacy regulations
- Stores data securely according to institutional policies

<Tip>
Use the security dashboard proactively throughout the assignment period, not just after the deadline. Early detection can help you address issues before they escalate.
