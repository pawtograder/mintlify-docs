# Assignment Security Dashboard

The assignment security dashboard helps instructors identify potential academic integrity concerns by analyzing submission patterns, code similarity, and other security-related metrics across student submissions.

## Accessing the Security Dashboard

Navigate to an assignment and select the **Security** tab to view the dashboard. This feature is available to instructors and head TAs.

## Dashboard Features

The security dashboard provides insights into:

- **Submission patterns**: Unusual submission timing or frequency
- **Code similarity**: Potential code sharing between students
- **Repository access**: Who has accessed student repositories
- **Suspicious activity**: Flagged behaviors that may indicate policy violations

## Monitoring Submission Patterns

The dashboard tracks:

1. **Submission timing**: Clusters of submissions at unusual times
2. **Last-minute submissions**: Students submitting very close to deadlines
3. **Multiple submissions**: Unusual patterns of repeated submissions
4. **Group coordination**: Submission patterns in group assignments

## Code Similarity Detection

<Warning>
Code similarity detection is a tool to help identify potential issues, not definitive proof of academic dishonesty. Always investigate flagged cases individually and give students the opportunity to explain.
</Warning>

The dashboard can identify:

- **High similarity scores**: Code that appears very similar between students
- **Common patterns**: Shared code structures or implementations
- **Unusual matches**: Similarity in unexpected places (e.g., students who don't know each other)

### Interpreting Similarity Scores

When reviewing similarity reports:

1. **Consider the assignment**: Some assignments naturally lead to similar solutions
2. **Check starter code**: Ensure similarity isn't just from the provided handout
3. **Review context**: Look at the specific code sections flagged
4. **Investigate thoroughly**: Talk to students before making accusations

## Repository Access Logs

Track who has accessed student repositories:

- **Staff access**: When TAs or instructors viewed submissions
- **Student access**: Repository activity by the student
- **External access**: Any unexpected access patterns

## Best Practices

<Tip>
Use the security dashboard as one tool among many for maintaining academic integrity. Combine it with clear policies, education about collaboration, and open communication with students.
</Tip>

### Recommendations

1. **Set clear expectations**: Communicate collaboration policies at the start of the course
2. **Regular monitoring**: Check the dashboard periodically, not just when suspicious
3. **Document findings**: Keep records of any flagged issues and investigations
4. **Fair process**: Always give students a chance to explain before taking action
5. **Privacy considerations**: Limit access to security data to authorized staff only

## Taking Action

When the dashboard flags potential issues:

1. **Review the evidence**: Examine the specific data that triggered the flag
2. **Gather context**: Look at the student's overall submission history
3. **Consult policies**: Ensure any action aligns with your institution's academic integrity policies
4. **Contact students**: Reach out privately to discuss the concern
5. **Document everything**: Keep detailed records of the investigation and outcome

## Privacy and Ethics

The security dashboard is designed with privacy in mind:

- **Limited access**: Only instructors and authorized staff can view security data
- **Secure storage**: All data is encrypted and access-logged
- **Ethical use**: Use the dashboard to support learning and fairness, not to surveil students
- **Transparency**: Consider informing students that security monitoring is in place

<Note>
The security dashboard is a tool to help maintain academic integrity, but it should be used responsibly and in conjunction with clear policies and fair procedures.
