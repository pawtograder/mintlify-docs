# Assignment Security Dashboard

The assignment security dashboard provides instructors with tools to monitor security-related events and identify potential academic integrity concerns across student submissions.

## Dashboard Overview

The security dashboard aggregates and displays security-relevant events, helping you:

- **Detect unusual patterns**: Identify suspicious submission behaviors or timing
- **Monitor access patterns**: Track repository access and commit activity
- **Review flagged events**: Investigate automatically flagged security concerns
- **Maintain academic integrity**: Ensure fair assessment practices

## Key Features

### Event Monitoring

The dashboard tracks various security-related events:

- **Submission timing**: Unusual submission patterns or timing anomalies
- **Repository access**: Who accessed student repositories and when
- **Commit patterns**: Frequency and timing of commits
- **Collaboration indicators**: Potential unauthorized collaboration signals

### Automated Flagging

The system automatically flags potentially concerning events:

- Multiple submissions in rapid succession
- Identical or highly similar code across different students
- Unusual repository access patterns
- Late-night or deadline-adjacent activity spikes

### Investigation Tools

When reviewing flagged events, you can:

- View detailed event timelines
- Compare submissions side-by-side
- Access complete repository history
- Export data for further analysis

## Using the Dashboard

### Accessing Security Data

Navigate to the assignment security dashboard from the assignment management page. Select an assignment to view its security overview.

### Reviewing Flagged Events

1. Review the list of flagged events sorted by severity
2. Click on an event to view detailed information
3. Investigate using the provided context and tools
4. Mark events as reviewed or escalate for further action

### Configuring Alerts

Customize which events trigger alerts:

- Set thresholds for automated flagging
- Configure notification preferences
- Define custom security rules for your course
- Adjust sensitivity based on assignment type

## Best Practices

- **Regular monitoring**: Check the dashboard periodically, especially around deadlines
- **Context matters**: Consider legitimate reasons for flagged events before taking action
- **Document findings**: Keep records of investigations and decisions
- **Communicate policies**: Ensure students understand academic integrity expectations
- **Use preventatively**: Share aggregate patterns (without identifying students) to educate about proper practices

## Privacy and Ethics

The security dashboard is designed to:

- Respect student privacy while maintaining academic integrity
- Provide context for informed decision-making
- Avoid false accusations through comprehensive data
- Support fair and consistent policy enforcement

Always review flagged events carefully and consider alternative explanations before concluding academic integrity violations have occurred.
