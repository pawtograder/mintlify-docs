# Extensions and Score Capping

Pawtograder provides flexible options for managing due date extensions and controlling assignment scores.

## Extended Due Date Picker

When granting manual extensions to students, instructors can choose the extended due date directly using a date picker interface.

### Benefits

The date picker approach offers several advantages over entering hours and minutes:

- **Intuitive selection**: Pick a specific date and time visually
- **Reduced errors**: Avoid calculation mistakes when determining extension length
- **Course alignment**: Easily set extensions that align with course schedules or other deadlines
- **Clear communication**: The exact due date is immediately visible

### How to Grant Extensions

1. Navigate to the assignment's "Due Date Exceptions" section
2. Select the student(s) who need an extension
3. Click "Grant Extension"
4. Use the date picker to select the new due date and time
5. The system displays both the original and extended due dates for reference

The date picker shows the original due date and allows you to select any future date and time for the extended deadline.

<Tip>
You can grant extensions to individual students or to entire groups for group assignments. All group members will receive the same extended deadline.

## Assignment Score Capping

Instructors can configure a maximum score cap for assignments to prevent scores from exceeding a specified limit.

### When to Use Score Capping

Score capping is useful in several scenarios:

- **Extra credit management**: Prevent bonus points from inflating grades beyond course standards
- **Grading consistency**: Ensure all assignments follow the same maximum score scale
- **Optional components**: Allow students to attempt bonus work without breaking grade calculations
- **Rubric flexibility**: Use detailed rubrics with many points while maintaining a standard maximum

### Configuring Score Caps

To set a score cap for an assignment:

1. Navigate to the assignment settings
2. Find the "Score Capping" section
3. Enable score capping
4. Enter the maximum allowed score
5. Save your changes

### How Score Capping Works

When score capping is enabled:

- Student scores are automatically capped at the specified maximum
- The cap applies to the total score (autograder + handgrading combined)
- Students can see their uncapped score and the capped score that counts toward their grade
- The gradebook displays the capped score

<Note>
Score capping is applied after all grading is complete. Students will still see their full earned score, but the capped score is what appears in the gradebook and grade exports.
</Note>

### Example

If you set a score cap of 100 points:
- A student who earns 95 points receives 95 points
- A student who earns 110 points (including bonus) receives 100 points
- Both students see their actual earned scores, but the gradebook shows the capped values

This allows you to reward excellent work with bonus points while maintaining grade consistency across your course.
