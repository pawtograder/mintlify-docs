# Grading Status Dashboard

The grading status dashboard provides instructors with a comprehensive view of grading progress for an assignment. This dashboard helps you track which submissions have been graded, identify bottlenecks, and ensure timely completion of grading tasks.

## Accessing the Dashboard

Navigate to an assignment and select the **Grading Status** tab to view the dashboard. The dashboard is available to instructors and head TAs.

## Dashboard Features

The grading status dashboard displays:

- **Overall progress**: Percentage of submissions that have been graded
- **Grading breakdown**: Number of submissions in each state (not started, in progress, completed)
- **Grader assignments**: Which staff members are assigned to which submissions
- **Completion timeline**: When grading tasks were completed
- **Outstanding tasks**: Submissions that still need grading

## Monitoring Grading Progress

Use the dashboard to:

1. **Track completion rates**: See how many submissions have been fully graded
2. **Identify delays**: Find submissions that are taking longer than expected
3. **Balance workload**: Ensure grading tasks are distributed evenly among staff
4. **Plan releases**: Determine when you can release grades to students

## Grading States

Submissions can be in one of several states:

- **Not started**: No grading has been completed
- **In progress**: Some rubric items have been graded, but the review is not complete
- **Completed**: All required rubric items have been graded (but not necessarily released)
- **Released**: Grades have been released to students

<Note>
Completing a review does not automatically release it to students. Instructors must explicitly release grades when ready.
</Note>

## Using the Dashboard for Grading Assignments

The grading status dashboard integrates with the grading assignment system. When you assign grading tasks to staff:

- The dashboard shows which grader is assigned to each submission
- You can track whether assigned graders have completed their tasks
- Overdue grading tasks are highlighted
- You can reassign tasks directly from the dashboard if needed

<Tip>
Check the grading status dashboard regularly during the grading period to ensure all submissions are being processed on time.
