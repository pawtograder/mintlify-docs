# Assignments Overview

Programming assignments are the core of Pawtograder. Each assignment consists of a "handout" repository, and optionally, a "grader" repository. When an assignment is released, Pawtograder automatically creates a new private repository for each student based on that handout. Pawtograder automatically manages permissions for all of these repositories, allowing staff to view all of a course's repositories, and ensuring students can only view their own repositories.

## GitHub Permissions

Pawtograder creates two GitHub teams for each class: a "staff" team and a "students" team. Staff are granted access to all class repositories, and students are only granted access to their own repositories. The "students" team can be used by instructors who want to create additional GitHub repositories that are only accessible to students (e.g. for distributing in-class exercises).

## Repositories

Two repositories are automatically created for each assignment: a "handout" repository and a "grader" repository. These repositories must be configured by the staff before the assignment is released.

A **handout repository** is a repository that contains the starter code for an assignment. It is used to provide students with the necessary files to complete the assignment.

A **grader repository** is a repository that contains the code that will be used to grade the assignment. It is used to provide instructors with the necessary files to grade the assignment.

## Individual and Group Assignments

Assignments can be individual, group-optional, or group-required.
Students can be assigned to groups by instructors, or can self-assign to groups.
Instructors can reuse a set of groups from a prior assignment.

## Due Date Exceptions

Instructors can set a class-wide number of late tokens, and configure assignments to allow students to use those tokens as desired.
Each token can be exchanged for a 24-hour extension, but the extension must be requested before the student's original due date.

Instructors and graders can also manually grant extensions to students, and can view all extensions granted to a student. This is done in the assignment configuration under "Due Date Exceptions".

## Assignment Leaderboard

Assignments can optionally include a leaderboard feature that displays top-performing students. The leaderboard:

- Shows rankings based on assignment scores
- Updates automatically as submissions are graded
- Can be toggled on or off per assignment
- Encourages student engagement through friendly competition

To enable or disable the leaderboard for an assignment, use the assignment configuration settings. When enabled, students will see their ranking and the top performers on the assignment page.

<Tip>
The leaderboard can be made optional to reduce competitive pressure while still providing visibility into class performance. Consider your course culture when deciding whether to enable this feature.
