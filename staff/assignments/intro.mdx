# Assignments Overview

Programming assignments are the core of Pawtograder. Each assignment consists of a "handout" repository, and optionally, a "grader" repository. When an assignment is released, Pawtograder automatically creates a new private repository for each student based on that handout. Pawtograder automatically manages permissions for all of these repositories, allowing staff to view all of a course's repositories, and ensuring students can only view their own repositories.

## GitHub Permissions

Pawtograder creates two GitHub teams for each class: a "staff" team and a "students" team. Staff are granted access to all class repositories, and students are only granted access to their own repositories. The "students" team can be used by instructors who want to create additional GitHub repositories that are only accessible to students (e.g. for distributing in-class exercises).

## Repositories

Two repositories are automatically created for each assignment: a "handout" repository and a "grader" repository. These repositories must be configured by the staff before the assignment is released.

A **handout repository** is a repository that contains the starter code for an assignment. It is used to provide students with the necessary files to complete the assignment.

A **grader repository** is a repository that contains the code that will be used to grade the assignment. It is used to provide instructors with the necessary files to grade the assignment.

## Individual and Group Assignments

Assignments can be individual, group-optional, or group-required.
Students can be assigned to groups by instructors, or can self-assign to groups.
Instructors can reuse a set of groups from a prior assignment.

## Due Date Exceptions

Instructors can set a class-wide number of late tokens, and configure assignments to allow students to use those tokens as desired.
Each token can be exchanged for a 24-hour extension, but the extension must be requested before the student's original due date.

Instructors and graders can also manually grant extensions to students, and can view all extensions granted to a student. This is done in the assignment configuration under "Due Date Exceptions".

When granting extensions, instructors can now choose an extended due date directly using a date picker, rather than entering extension hours and minutes. This makes it easier to set specific deadlines for individual students.

## Assignment Leaderboard

Assignments can include an optional leaderboard feature that displays student rankings based on their scores. This feature:

- Can be enabled or disabled per assignment
- Shows student rankings in a less cluttering way
- Helps motivate students through friendly competition
- Is configurable to match your course's pedagogical goals

Instructors can control whether the leaderboard is visible to students and customize its display settings.

## Score Capping

Instructors can set a maximum score cap for assignments. This feature allows you to:

- Limit the maximum points a student can earn on an assignment
- Prevent extra credit from inflating grades beyond a certain threshold
- Maintain consistent grading scales across assignments

Score capping is configured per assignment and applies after all autograder and handgrading scores are calculated.
