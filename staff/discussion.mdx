# Discussion Board

Pawtograder's discussion board feature allows students and staff to discuss course content and ask questions. It is **not** intended to be a replacement for office hours, although there is an option to format the post as a question that needs an answer (as opposed to a "note" that does not need an answer).

## Key Features

### Feed and Topic Organization

The discussion board uses a feed-based layout with two main views:

- **My Feed**: Shows all posts relevant to you, including posts from topics you follow
- **Browse Topics**: Allows you to explore posts organized by topic categories

Posts can be filtered by "Followed topics" to show only content from categories you're interested in.

### Pinned Posts

Instructors can pin important posts that appear in a dedicated "Pinned Posts" section in the sidebar. This is useful for:

- Highlighting frequently asked questions
- Surfacing important announcements
- Drawing attention to helpful resources

Pinned posts remain visible and easily accessible regardless of how many new posts are created.

### Post Visibility and Identity

Posts can be shared with the entire class, or with course staff only. Each user in a class has a pseudonym, and can choose to use their real name or their pseudonym. Staff can always see the real name of a user.

Students can edit their own posts, and staff can edit any post.

### Rich Content Support

Posts support Markdown formatting and include drag-and-drop image upload functionality. Users can:
- Drag images directly into the post editor
- Paste images from clipboard
- Upload attachments to support their questions or explanations

This makes it easy to share screenshots, diagrams, and other visual content when discussing course material.

### Post Metadata

Each post displays:

- **Topic tag**: Color-coded category (e.g., "Logistics", "Assignments")
- **Author email**: The poster's identity
- **Timestamp**: When the post was created
- **Reply count**: Number of responses, with indicators for new replies
- **Like count**: Community engagement metric
- **Answered badge**: Indicates whether a question has been resolved

## Active Help Request Integration

When a student has an active help request in office hours, a widget appears in the discussion board sidebar showing:

- The current status of their help request (e.g., "in_progress")
- Video call notifications when staff starts a video chat
- A "Join Video Call" button for quick access to help sessions

This integration ensures students never miss updates on their help requests, even while browsing the discussion board.

## Karma System

The discussion board includes a karma system that rewards students for helpful contributions. Students earn karma points through:

- Receiving likes on their posts
- Having their answers marked as helpful
- Generating meaningful engagement in discussions

Karma scores are visible on student profiles and serve as a measure of community contribution. This system encourages students to:
- Provide thoughtful, helpful responses
- Actively participate in course discussions
- Support their peers' learning

As an instructor, you can use karma scores to identify students who are particularly engaged and helpful in the course community.

## Notifications

By default, users do not get notifications for new posts, but can optionally "watch" a post to receive notifications when the post is updated or receives a new reply. Interacting with a post (e.g. replying to it) will automatically watch the post.
