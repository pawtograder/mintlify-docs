# Discussion Board

Pawtograder's discussion board feature allows students and staff to discuss course content and ask questions. It is **not** intended to be a replacement for office hours, although there is an option to format the post as a question that needs an answer (as opposed to a "note" that does not need an answer).

## Key Features

### Feed and Topic Organization

The discussion board uses a feed-based layout with two main views:

- **My Feed**: Shows all posts relevant to you, including posts from topics you follow
- **Browse Topics**: Allows you to explore posts organized by topic categories

Posts can be filtered by "Followed topics" to show only content from categories you're interested in.

### Pinned Posts

Instructors can pin important posts that appear in a dedicated "Pinned Posts" section in the sidebar. This is useful for:

- Highlighting frequently asked questions
- Surfacing important announcements
- Drawing attention to helpful resources

Pinned posts remain visible and easily accessible regardless of how many new posts are created.

### Post Visibility and Identity

Posts can be shared with the entire class, or with course staff only. Each user in a class has a pseudonym, and can choose to use their real name or their pseudonym. Staff can always see the real name of a user.

Students can edit their own posts, and staff can edit any post.

### Image Uploads

Posts and replies support drag-and-drop image uploads. Students and staff can simply drag image files directly into the post editor, and they will be automatically uploaded and embedded using Markdown syntax. This makes it easy to share screenshots, diagrams, error messages, and other visual content.

### Post Metadata

Each post displays:

- **Topic tag**: Color-coded category (e.g., "Logistics", "Assignments")
- **Author email**: The poster's identity
- **Timestamp**: When the post was created
- **Reply count**: Number of responses, with indicators for new replies
- **Like count**: Community engagement metric
- **Karma**: Points earned by users for helpful contributions
- **Answered badge**: Indicates whether a question has been resolved

## Active Help Request Integration

When a student has an active help request in office hours, a widget appears in the discussion board sidebar showing:

- The current status of their help request (e.g., "in_progress")
- Video call notifications when staff starts a video chat
- A "Join Video Call" button for quick access to help sessions

This integration ensures students never miss updates on their help requests, even while browsing the discussion board.

## Notifications

By default, users do not get notifications for new posts, but can optionally "watch" a post to receive notifications when the post is updated or receives a new reply. Interacting with a post (e.g. replying to it) will automatically watch the post.
