### Survey JSON Editor

Advanced users may directly modify the SurveyJS configuration when creating a new survey. Use the visual builder first, then fine-tune in JSON mode if needed.

- The JSON textarea shows the raw SurveyJS configuration
- Click **Validate JSON** to check for syntax errors before saving
- Changes in the Visual Builder automatically update the JSON

<Note>
The JSON editor is for advanced users familiar with the [SurveyJS JSON format](https://surveyjs.io/documentation). Most users should use the Visual Builder instead.
</Note>

### Previewing Your Survey

Before publishing, preview how students will see your survey:

1. Click **Show Preview** in the preview section
2. A modal displays the survey exactly as students will experience it
3. Test navigation between pages (for multi-page surveys)

</Tip>

## Peer Feedback Surveys

Peer feedback surveys allow students to provide constructive feedback about their teammates in group projects. A pre-built **Peer Feedback Survey** template is available in the Template Library.

### Current Implementation

Peer feedback surveys use the **Assign to specific students** assignment mode. The instructor assigns the survey to students who need to provide feedback, and responses are collected like any other survey.

<Note>
The current implementation does not include automated peer-to-peer assignment (e.g., automatically assigning Student A to review Student B). Instructors manually assign surveys to students who should provide feedback. Future versions may include automated peer assignment features.
</Note>

### Peer Feedback Template Structure

The built-in peer feedback template includes the following questions that can be customized for your course:

**Rating Questions (1-5 scale):**
- Overall contribution to the project
- Communication effectiveness with the group
- Reliability in completing assigned tasks on time
- Collaboration and supportiveness
- Quality of work produced

**Multi-Select Question:**
- Team member strengths (Technical skills, Problem-solving, Communication, Leadership, Time management, Creativity, Attention to detail, Helping others)

**Open-Ended Questions:**
- What did this team member do well?
- What could this team member improve on?
- Additional comments (optional)

### Using the Peer Feedback Template

1. Click **Create New Survey**
2. Click **Load Template**
3. Search for "Peer Feedback Survey"
4. Click **Clone** to use the template
5. Customize questions as needed for your course context
6. Use **Assign to specific students** to assign to group members
7. Publish when ready

### Viewing Peer Feedback Responses

Peer feedback responses are visible only to instructors and graders. Students can only see their own submitted responses, not feedback others have provided.

To review peer feedback:
1. Navigate to the survey's **View Responses** page
2. Use filters to focus on specific questions or date ranges
3. Export to CSV for detailed analysis or grade calculations

## Managing Survey Responses

### Viewing Response Dashboard

Click **View Responses** on any published survey to see the response dashboard.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/staff/surveys/survey-response-dashboard.png" alt="Survey Response Dashboard with metrics and data table" />
</Frame>

The dashboard displays three key metrics at the top:

#### Total Responses

Shows the current number of submitted responses.

#### Response Rate

Percentage of enrolled students who have submitted responses. Calculated as:

```text
Response Rate = (Total Responses / Total Enrolled Students) × 100
```

#### Time Remaining

Dynamic countdown to the due date:

- **Black**: More than 24 hours remaining (displays days and hours)
- **Orange**: Less than 24 hours remaining (displays hours and minutes)
- **Red**: Past due date (displays "Closed")

### Response Data Table

The table shows all student responses with columns for:

- Student name
- Submission timestamp
- Answers to each survey question (dynamic columns)

**Column Headers**: Question titles automatically populate as column headers. Long question text is truncated for readability.

**Empty Responses**: Shows "—" for unanswered questions.

**Complex Answers**: Arrays display as comma-separated values (e.g., "Option A, Option C").

### Filtering Responses

Click the **Filters** button to open the filter panel with advanced options:

#### Date Range Filter

Filter responses submitted within a specific time period:

1. Select a start date
2. Select an end date
3. Only responses submitted between these dates display

**Use Cases:**

- Analyze early vs. late responders
- Track response patterns over time
- Identify submission clusters before deadline

#### Anonymous Mode

Hide student identifying information for unbiased analysis:

- Removes student names column

#### Question Selection Filter

Display only specific questions of interest:

1. Check/uncheck questions to show or hide
2. Reduces information overload for large surveys
3. Focus on specific topics or concerns

**Active Filters Display**: Blue badges show currently applied filters with quick-remove (×) buttons.

### Exporting Response Data

Click **Export to CSV** to download all response data for external analysis.

**CSV Format:**

```csv
Student Name,Submitted At,Question 1,Question 2,...
Jane Doe,"Nov 15, 2025, 3:45 PM",Answer 1,Answer 2,...
John Smith,"Nov 16, 2025, 10:22 AM",Answer 1,Answer 2,...
```

**Features:**

- Properly escaped values for Excel/Google Sheets compatibility
- Filename includes survey title and export date

## Editing Surveys

### Editing Draft Surveys

Draft surveys can be edited freely with no restrictions:

1. Click **Edit** button on the survey card
2. Modify title, description, questions, or settings
3. Save changes and continue working
4. No student impact since draft surveys are not visible

### Editing Published Surveys

<Warning>
Editing published surveys should be done carefully as it may affect student experience.
</Warning>

**What You Can Safely Edit:**

- Survey title (won't affect existing responses)
- Description (provides context for future responders)
- Due date (can extend deadline if needed)
- Allow response editing setting

**What to Avoid Editing:**

- Survey questions (may invalidate existing responses)
- Question types (data type mismatch with existing responses)
- Removing questions (orphans existing response data)

**Best Practice**: If substantial changes are needed, create a new survey version rather than modifying a published survey with responses.

### Validation and Error Handling

The system validates surveys before publishing:

- Ensures due date is in the future (cannot publish with past due date)
- Validates JSON structure of survey questions
- Checks for required fields (title, question structure)

**Validation Errors:**

- Error message displays explaining the issue
- Must fix errors before publishing

## Saving Survey Templates

Share your successful survey designs with others or reuse them in future semesters:

1. Open an existing survey (published or draft)
2. Click **Add to Template Library**
3. Choose template scope:
   - **Course Only**: Available only in your course
   - **Global (Shared)**: Available to all instructors across courses

## Deleting Surveys

To remove a survey from your course:

1. Click actions button and choose **Delete**
2. Confirm deletion in the dialog box
3. Survey and all associated response data are permanently deleted
